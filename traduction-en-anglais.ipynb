Digital Services Issue Fort 01 Major Flow and Challenges of Cloud Computing in 2021. It is higher than ever.In particular, digital services such as cloud computing have not covered public sectors and private sectors, and digital calls are now rapidly become a task assignment that companies and governments are not affordable. Therefore, seeing the main flow of cloud computing in 2021 and the challenges to solve the future is very meaningful at this time.This article will be the main report on Market forecasting the Market Professional Market, CNN, Forbes, Tech HQ, and Sometimes, I organized the issue. The center of the Global Public Cloud Infrastructure Market for overcoming the Pan Demic Overcoming the Foreign Research will be expected to be $ 35 percent in 2021, with a 35% increase in 2021.1) In a global pan demam, all businesses and organizations are rapidly done by the conversion of clouds, which will be a faster rapidly in 2021. The number of predictions in the past was that the number of predictions in the past was that it will be $ 1,13.1 billion in growth, but it will increase its number. Without cloud apps, tools, services, businesses, millions of employees would have worked at home and could not manage the global supply chain, and they could not transfer the entire business model in a week.Ethachi chooses Google Cloud to handle traffic to Ikomers, and Lowe made a pickup app in three days, and used moderated AWS to accelerate corona-19 vaccine research. In this period, public cloud companies have done rapid sales growth, 29% of AWS, 47% of Microsoft, 47%, Google Cloud, and Alibaba were growing 59%. Now the Global Public Cloud is AWS and Assistance, then Alibaba ranked 3rd.The growth of Alibaba is a growing growth by all industries and digital digitization in China, especially the Internet, financial and retail industries are considered a major growth driver.1) Forrester Research, \"Predictions 2021,\" OCT 2020 3 Digital Service Issues, but cloud computing, it should be aware that the conversion is not just improved, but it is not just improved performance or cost savings, repeatedly optimization and Recognizing that it is to meet the present and future goals, the demand for clubs will increase. Gartner is expected to accelerate the cost increase in the cloud in the CLUEW in the world in 2021.The cost of the global end user is expected to reach $ 3,04.9 billion to $ 3,04.9 billion in the public cloud. It is expected to grow 26.6% to $ 26.6%. Iaas predicts 26.9% growth to $ 65.3 billion. The growth of PAAS is expected to be further accelerated by remote work environment, which is seen as a change in accordance with the strategic direction of the company that wants to get the financial benefits as much as possible.According to Flexera (Flexera), companies were found to expand more cloud use than Corona -19.3) (Figure 1) Figure 1 Increased cloud usage due to corona -19 [Source: Frequera] 2) CRN, \"10 Future Cloud Computing Trends to Watch in 2021,\" Nov 20, 2020 3) Flexera, \"Flexera Releases 2020 State of Cloiud Report,\" APR 28, 2020 4 Digital Service Issuesuimi Fort Edge Computing is a new cloud edge It is a new cloud and an emergence of a new business model that leads to edge adoption is expected to be forors.Especially, the use of cloud platforms, artificial intelligence and 3 edge use will be expanded. Dell, HPE, IBM, Intel will focus on solutions based on edge, and CDNs or data center corosity vendors are expected to provide edge computing services at hundreds of, and thousands of local points. As a prediction of Frost & Sullivation, in the second half of 2021, 90% of the enterprises of the industrial zone will use edge computing, and 5G spreads to greatly trigger the demand for cloud-edge applications.4) More work will be based on an edge based on the edge of smart sensor data and a small-scale machine running task. The centralized cloud will continue, but serverless computing models and distributed services will provide strength to new real-time IT applications around the cloud.Companies will look at network edges for filling the gap between centralized clouds and end users, and will provide low-delay applications and content performance wherever they work. As a result, incorporating a wide range of cloud computing and distributed edge strategies should be a major region during innovation to continue in 2021.In addition, in this flow, companies can accept the distributed application environment, and emphasize security and user protection in the enterprise network edge. IBM / Red Hat, HPE, Microsoft will make more investments in strategic 5G / edge / artificial intelligence platforms launched in 2020, and NVIDIA, who acquired Cancer (ARM), also expands the portfolio of its solution to the edge something to do.Artificial Intelligence Engineering Gartner said that in the 2021 Top Strategy Technology Trend Report, the artificial intelligence project should not fail through a strong artificial intelligent engineering strategy .5) Without artificial intelligence engineering, most organizations are an artificial intelligence project I think that the concept certificate or prototype will not move to full-fledged products or services.4) Frost and Sullivan, \"5G and Edge Computing-Cloud Workloads Shifting to The Edge, Forecast to 2024,\" AUG 2020 5) Gartner, \"Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021,\" Oct 19, 2020 5 Digital Service Issue Report Artificial Intelligent projects are not successful due to maintenance, scalability, and governance issues. We have a lot of comprehension, scalability, interpretability, and reliability through powerful artificial intelligence engineering, and to have full value due to artificial intelligence investment can do. Artificial intelligence engineering can be a part of the Main Stream Devox process, not a special and separate project, artificial intelligence.There are three important factors, data options, model options, and Devo. Devovs deals primarily because it deals with a quick speed code change, because the artificial intelligence project experiences dynamic changes in code, model, and data. The DevoX principle must be applied across the data pipeline for data and machine running models, and it is called MLOPS to comprehensively.For governance and artificial intelligence engineering, reliable artificial intelligence is emerging as a single umbrella, which should deal with artificial intelligence risks, trust, transparency, ethics, fairness, interpretation, responsibilities, safety and compliance. This should now be implemented in a full-fledged implementation of the declaration and principles to implement how to deal with an artificial intelligence at the organization and social level.In order to avoid hybrids, multi-clouds and joint service companies for companies, they would like to take away from a particular cloud vendor by using hybrids and multi-clouds or joint cloud services in earnest in 20021. This strategy is already a mainstream, and as a result of Flexera (Flexera), 93% of the enterprise is said to have a hybrid cloud strategy of 87% of the multi-cloud strategy.Already AWS, Microsoft, Google accepts a company through hybrid / multi-cloud offerings, and private cloud-centric companies, IBM, HPE, Cisco, Dell EMC, VMware, etc. Major Public Cloud Services Enterprises and its hybrids / multi We want to keep market share while providing cloud integration. Nevertheless, this area shows the transmission status, and AWS's outposts or Google Antos does not seem to increase its market share greatly.Multi-cloud and hybrid clouds will allow companies to share data with their partners, or they will create a partner's data, which will also create mutual operations in an environment using various applications and data standards. This field can make new innovations in the startup, and a service that may emerge a more simple operating process among different platform providers.6 Digital Service Issuesu Fort Big Tech Enterprise Construction of Open Ecosystem In recent years, regulations on Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, etc., will also affect the cloud strategy of the Big Tech enterprise. Major cloud companies will gradually reduce strategic arguments, and they will pour more power to build an ecosystem based on open partnerships. This will be an effort to escape from the doubt that potential competitors were blocked through the acquisition.They will have a back-end fullfilling agent to help enterprise deals that partners are led by partners. Through this movement, it is a more powerful partnership and competitive innovative startup or intergentee business with more powerful partnerships and competitiveness so that it is more and more difficult to controversiate and controversy about the ruling and excessive dominance of the randomly strengthening. It is expected to strengthen the linkage cooperation. Cloud Gaming Amazon also has recently released a service that provides cloud gaming.Now, as you are streaming music or videos in the cloud, cloud gaming will greatly change the way you enjoy the game, and you will make a vast game library to access the monthly account.In 2020, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Sony, and Sony have provided services, and the new game console, such as Xbox, Sony, but in the future, it is a cloud gaming method rather than a game service that replaces the device every few years. Most experts are predicting that this will be this flagship service.However, it will be a judgment on how quickly the best selling game that people can be enthusiastic will be able to accelerate this flow, and we will be able to confirm the guest this year. More people use virtual desktops to use the home desktop, the Subscription Economy, and the Cloud will reduce the purchase of the hardware needed to work and enable the most up-to-date software through the appropriate level desktop.'Desktop-as-A-Service as a service' is now a service provided by most public cloud companies. Amazon's workspace, Microsoft's Windows Virtual Desktop, and Google's Commuba's service is a typical service group. Indeed, through these services, employees can use the latest simultaneous integrated technology to enhance the efficiency of the entire workforce.In addition, in the mid-pressure centralized manner, the security of all devices can be managed by 7 digital service issues, and when the employee joins or leaves the company, there is only flexibility to increase or reduce the cost of time using the platform. Domestic companies or institutions are now a regimen for virtual desktop services in earnests will become a naturally important issue as a result of changes in Corona -19 era business environments.8 Digital Services Issue Report 02 Distributed Cloud, The Background and Future Views ‚îÇ On the background of the Distributed Cloud, the Distributed Cloud, the Distributed Cloud, Gattan, announces the main strategy technology trends that will be the following year. It is only the impact that can be part of the technology as well as the effects that can be in the overall industry, furthermore, and the change in life that the general people will face through these trend analysis. We presented nine keywords with strategic technology in 2021. These nine are divided into three topics:≈∏ PEOPLE CENTRICITY √ø Location Independence √ø Rescue Independence √ø Resilient Delivery In the background of three categories above, there is a Corona -19 pan demic that was not precedent. In situations where direct contact between people is limited, most companies are in earnest in earnest, and the non-lateral remote lectures are \"new standards\" in the site, and are interested in the skills they need to effectively operate them.In the field of service, it is generally called User Experience (Customer Experience), which is optimized for each field, including a customer experience, a patient experience, and an employe experience, and an overall experience (Total Experience) ) The term term appeared. In addition, the frequency of exposed to online is high and the privacy of privacy has become more emphasized. This is expressed as a \"person-centered\" category.Due to the universalization of telecommuting and non-standing remote lectures, it is now necessary to work anywhere, regardless of the location, and it is necessary to make a certain level of performance despite the change of the unexpected situation. The techniques for this are included in the & quot; positionless & quot;, & quot; elastic delivery & quot; category. With the conversion of the non-infrared situation, things that do not have to be specifically done in the conventionalness may act as an important factor in which things that do not have to be specifically needed to disable. An example is a non-surface test.In the traditional test method, which was done in a closed space, a negative manager, which was not a problem was not a problem, is a very big issue in a non-problem. This is because the behavioral observation of the examination is virtually impossible in the non-surface environment. As a result, new services to solve them have appeared in the faster. Authorized solutions that use artificial intelligence are included in this category that automated solutions that do not have to observe users.Looking at this from another angle, it is realistic in many areas of division of business. \"Test coach\" is differentiated into a separate function in the business of the great category of education, and forms a new market. This is a technique mentioned in \"Elastic delivery\" to effectively combine these unbundling and differentiated functions to effectively respond to new requirements. Non-later remote work is generalized and the concept of work is changing.If you are connected to a network and only basic access equipment, it becomes a place where I have a place. In fact, San Francisco's software engineers are also identifying a residence in San Diego, a much cheaper San Diego, and a case of home is also identified. This is the same as the employee as well as for customers. Whether the customer is, the business should be able to operate smoothly, regardless of whether they are physically located. Strategy technology for this is covered by \"positionless\" subject in Gartner.The three subjects presented by Gartner are not independent of each, but may be interconnected or some duplicate. Many users are instructed through this strategy technology through the cloud. In particular, the role of the cloud is absolutely important for business operations that are not related to physical location. Many companies operate their own on-premise infrastructure with the public cloud, or operate a private cloud compatible with public cloud in a more evolved form.The hive lead cloud utilization case, which simultaneously utilizes the public cloud and private cloud, is very diverse. Typically, security issues can be mentioned. The data sensitive to security issues, such as privacy and corporate confidentiality, is stored in a dedicated private cloud, enhancing security, and other data is to ensure scalability and flexibility by being in the public cloud. It also places a dedicated cloud in the agency or far position to perform a job that requires a short response time to be stably.It is to eliminate the delay element on the Internet. How homework, a homework that can come out as a new standard of duties is a new standard of work, how to overcome these benefits. If you have a job in the San Francisco, you mentioned above, you will be able to work with a normal Telecommunications, for example, if you have to perform a response that requires a response to a response time, for example, In this situation, it will be almost impossible to work stably.However, in order to solve this, it is a field that can not build a dedicated private cloud near the San Diego house where the staff resides. What is the employee in Arizona Phoenix? What are the employees who work out in foreign countries? For the purpose of this requirement, a distributed cloud (Distributed Cloud) will receive attention to 10 digital service issue.For public cloud vendors, we are trying to accommodate various requirements in any location by expanding the existing regional (region) based service. What is a distributed cloud? \"Cloud Computing\" is traditionally implied that the meaning of centralized computing. It is the basic concept of cloud computing to collect the storage and computing resources in one place and take it efficiently.Therefore, it can be seen that the \"distributed cloud\" itself is contradictory to cloud computing. Many companies / agencies are as follows:≈∏ Efficiency of computing resources: Efficiency of infrastructure investment (√ø) Based on demand based on demand, extension / reducing, utilization of various latest technologies and functions: I can focus on the development of business / institutional business functions that utilize the functionality provided in the cloud It is a distributed cloud to \"distribute\" to ensure that \"most of the\" customer \"can be serviced as long as the\" customer \"is as close as possible in locally, while maintaining the strength of the cloud computing service.This concept already existed with the expansion of the hivelead cloud. In particular, there is a high interest in edge computing, with recent 5G commercialization, and the expansion of the distributed cloud is expected to be expected. As mentioned in the background description, Corona-19 pan Demam was further accelerated, and it has become one of the 2021 strategic technology trends. In Gartner, the distributed cloud is divided into several styles as follows:6) √ø On-premises Public Cloud: Public Cloud Services Constructed in Enterprise / Institutional Site √ø IoT Edge Cloud: Cloud Services for Edge Devices √ø Metrro-Area Community Cloud: Customers in the city or Metropolitan area Cloud Services √ø 5G Mobile Edge Cloud: Cloud Services Offered within a Carrier Network √ø Global Network Edge Cloud: Network Infrastructure Router, Base Station,The expression of \"on-premises public cloud\" in the above-mentioned cloud service, which is provided in the same place as herbs, is very awkward. This is because \"on-premises\" and \"public\", which are incompatible words are incompatible with two words. It is probably understood that it means receiving a managed service provided by the Public Cloud Vendor, but the Gartner, \"Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021\", 2020 11 Digital Service Issues, but is perhaps.In fact, main cloud vendors provide all of these management services. The Metropolitan Community Service is a concept that extends regional services for regions that are particularly demanded. For example, Amazon AWS started Local Zone service in the US Los Angeles area for the first time at the end of 2019.7) Due to the development of the entertainment media industry, it is easy to access and delay time It can be seen that it is necessary to respond to customer demand characteristics that need to be reduced.It was also considered that there are many employees who have remote working in this area. For local zone services, part of the cloud functionality provided in the region is provided in regional customized. In the case of the San Diego and remote worker mentioned above, if there is a local zone service near San Diego and the local zone service, a more pleasant and fast response work environment will be available. The most commonly referred to in the type of distributed cloud presented in Gartner is the edge cloud.In fact, it is also an edge computing that has become a picture of the dispersion Clarwood in earnest. A common feature is to provide a cloud service that is close to the final device that is possible to minimize the delay due to the network between the device and the cloud. If so, how close is it? There is no common criteria for this.Every time you go to the network equipment, it is usually added to the maximum hop (HOP), which is to be limited to the maximum hop, or if it can be connected immediately without the delayed element, it is a idea that it can be connected. The first proposed fog computing (Fog Computing), which is the first network equipment manufacturer, is also a similar concept with Edge Cloud. Edge Clouds are 5G services, and more specifically reveal the appearance.Particularly noteworthy in terms of distributed clouds is a cloud service that the public cloud service vendor offers vendors. A physically most common form and an easy understanding method is to provide a public cloud vendor service within a data center with a carrier. A typical example is a Wavelength Zone (Wavelength Zone). 8) A \"small\" AWS is in the community area for execution of AWS applications that meet 5G superior (URLLC) standards.Currently, through Verizon, in the United States, KDDI, and in Japan, it is said to be provided through SKT in Korea. For an Azure (Azure) operated by Microsoft, an EDGE Zone service is provided through the EDGE ZONE service .9) As an as an asman of Azer Edge Zone, as well as a carrier, as well as a managed private cloud service, or AWS Local Zone Metron 7) Businesswire, \"AWS Announces First AWS LOCAL ZONE in Los Angeles\", DEC 03, 2019 8) https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/ 9) https://azure.microsoft.com/ko -KR / Solutions / Low-Latency-Edge-Computing / 12 Digital Services This can be used as a disashimi community extension.In other words, it can be seen as a typical image of a distributed cloud. (Figure 2) Figure 2 Distributed Cloud Example: Microsoft Urgin (Picture Source Microsoft) The most witness in the future is the most witnessed distributed cloud forms of a number of edge clouds. Here are managed private cloud services, and local customized public cloud expansion services, are current and near future distributed cloud services.Distributed Cloud Services Yes Case Distributed Clouds have already been mentioned in the future, but it will be helpful to establish a cloud strategy in the future, but to look at this by Yuz Case. In IBM, we have organized distributed cloud uses case: 10) √ø Give and managing the visibility of hybrid / multi-clouds: enable the hybrid / multi-cloud to easily manage the hybrid / multi-cloud in enterprises and institutions.≈∏ Efficient expansion and agility: expanding data centers or establishing a new area in a new area and takes a long time to take a long time. Using a distributed cloud, cloud extensions operated in the same way can be accomplished quickly and efficiently.10) IBM, \"Distributed Cloud\", NOV 3, 2020 13 Digital Service Issue Report √ø Compliance required in certain industries or regions: For personal information, if personal information, , It is easy to respond to this regulations through the distributed cloud. In addition, we can apply techniques and methods such as using existing public clouds while meting compliance issues that are limited to various locations or regions.≈∏ Fast Contents Delivery Network (CDN) performance can be effectively enhanced, and therefore content consumption can enhance the user experience in the streaming service, these days. ≈∏ IoT and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Applications: Applications with high real-time requirements such as smart factories, smart buildings, autonomous travelers, healthcare, which are referred to as the core Yuz Case of Edge Computing. The yield of the distributed cloud is naturally overlapping with edge computing and a substantial part.It is neither defined that a large number of edge clouds gathered is a distributed cloud. The classification of hybrid / multi-clouds as a major Yuke case in the distributed cloud is that the introduction of clouds in the enterprise is determined, and it is judged that it is determined that the introduction of cloud is more authentic and can be seen as IBM's marketing message that conveys it against the corporate market. Distributed Cloud Forecasts The distributed clouds are already guessed by some extent of the development of the distributed cloud.Public Cloud Service The vendor's strategy should be presented. AWS or aerosols Large cloud service vendors will direct distributed cloud services that can be integrated in the same way as existing global cloud operations. AWS Wave Leaves Zone or Azer Edgezone is a distributed cloud service example designed in this direction. As an aspect view, it is expected that the spread of edge cloud-oriented and hybrid / multi-cloud expansion will be active.5G diffusion is delayed rather than anticipated by corona-19, but the edge cloud centered on the carrier is expected to spread rapidly. Currently, the cloud service vendors have a major axis operating in the communications area, but in future telecomers, the attempts to attempt to switch themselves to their new revenue models by their own internalization of these cloud services. In the future, this results are wondering how the cloud market will change.The introduction of hybrid cloud will continue to expand largely. According to the survey of cloud reports annually, 11) 87% of the entire enterprise have a hybrid cloud introduction strategy. Hybrid Clavium 11) Flexera, \"Flexera 2020 State of the Cloud Report\", 2019 14 Digital Service Issuesu Fortwood is pretending to build a private cloud. In other words, the expansion of the hybrid cloud is directly connected to the diffusion of the distributed cloud.5G The edge cloud spread of the carrier consisting of the dissemination, and the hybrid cloud expansion of the hybrid cloud is a congestion that leads to the distributed cloud. (Figure 3) Figure 3 Corporate cloud service utilization strategy (Source: Flexera 2020 State of the Clout Report) There is also a very interesting aspect of the distributed cloud as a very interesting aspect. The company expands hybrid client introduction and is present as on-premises in a small cloud form of a small size of the public cloud function.This \"small cloud\" is virtually a dedicated cloud of companies or institutions that can be used in almost the same way with public clouds. This is to use this hybrid cloud. In the next step, this cloud is available to use this cloud together .12) Of course, it is difficult to pursue a general enterprise easily. However, the hybrid cloud operated by the public institution, the library, and university is a fully possible scenari.This will naturally be able to see the benefits of distributed clouds to more users. It seems that it is not appropriate to see off the size of the distributed cloud market. Because it is a variety of families, it is because it does not matter if it is said that the market size can be obtained.However, there is sufficient circumstances that are sufficiently attached to the change and new services, and the density computing spreads, and hybrid clouds, such as the Corona-19 pan demic. Existing public cloud service vendors and carriers are moving very quickly. In this fast movement, companies are also adapting to the speed. On the other hand, companies that provide end-service will also accommodate changes in this trend.You should also evaluate how well these services are in the digital service marketplace in which they are circulating in the future. 12) Gartner, \"The CIO's Guide to Distributed Cloud\", AUG 12, 2020 15 Digital Service Issue Report 03 Corporate Cloud Selection Criteria and Latest Trend „Ö£ Senior Program Manager Corporate CEO Point of Corporation Corresponding to Cloud Conversion Corona -19 World To companies, digital transformers (hereinafter referred to as 'DT') to further hurry up.At the center of the DT, the selection option is the first to select the selection option, and it is an atmosphere to understand the conversion of the cloud to complete the DT. Recently, the cloud market in 1 or 2 years has brought quantitative qualitative explosive growth. It is simply a choice of viability to continue the business of a company, not just a new technology choice. Gart You would use cloud services for business essential functions for more than 85% of business organizations until 2021.As this tendency is gradually accelerated, the corporate cloud market is very clear compared to a year ago. In the middle of such a change, many companies' top leadership in the cloud conversion, the opinions of what tasks should first be prepared and executed are fraudulent, and there are a lot of new confusions that have been divided according to each group. Let's assume that you are CEO of one company.Think of what you need to ask for a successful business goal by switching to a cloud environment as a CEO that does not know the technology. For this question, McKinse is said to have advised the highest information / technical officer of the company for the following three perspectives: 14). Building funding models for investment needed to get business value in the cloud. Develop a new business model that utilizes the cloud for speed, agility and scalability.CEO's questions on the compensation policy, which are required to attract and maintain the professional engineers needed for cloud operations, is that the company focuses on creating it in the enterprise before discussing the cloud technology itself. And the technology that is conformed to that value is selected and operated 13) Gartner Webinar, Ed Anderson, \"Top Cloud Adoption Trends to Advance Digital Transformation\", SEP 03, 2020 14) Mckinsey Article, \"Three Actions CEO Scan Take to Get Value From FROM Cloud Computing \", Jul 21, 2020 16 Digital Services Issues Lipot.We want to find out what tasks should be converted to the conversion of the business of the company, focusing on this perspective, and to find out how to convert them to the conversion of the businesses in 2020. It is not a luxurious brochure that explains that the brand or consulting firms of cloud platform providers that provide solutions that provide solutions to the five-criteria of the cloud choice is to introduce the cloud solution.Moreover, \"Who has introduced this cloud like this, and there was a ride-up case, which was a non-work efficiency,\" which is a clear data that must be conservatively accepted. As a company that provides one enterprise that provides a single enterprise, the following five cloud conversions are prepared to be prepared to implement the following products, It is the best scenario to weave.After that, the platform service provider that can best support its essential work is based on selection. (Figure 4) Figure 4 Five criteria of a club platform selection for enterprise 17 Digital service is a digital service. Collaboration and Content Management Support Corporate essential applications such as ERP, CRM, SCM, and HCM, which make all basic businesses of support companies, become the first of the conversion consideration. In addition, the office solution that facilitates basic collaboration such as Office 365 or Google G Suite is needed to convert to the cloud.This basic application is extensively and horizontally applied to the tissue, so the optimal cloud effect is seen. The cloud-based collaboration model enables more remote access and satisfies the recovery of recovery of work. In addition, it is necessary to be considered as a top priority with the vast content (such as documents, images, multimedia, etc.) held by the enterprise, which is the part of the legal and governance structure and the license model to be carefully reviewed while reviewing the license model very carefully.At times, it may be difficult to completely switch content management into the cloud, but it is not necessary to invent basic cloud conversion even if such an exception occurs. me. Mobility and video conferencing support Mobile devices using mobile devices to access corporate main services and data are required in situations where remote work is a new standard.As a result of demand for video conferencing technology in Corona-19, mobile devices and video conferences can continue to continue the most important tasks. Using an Adaptive Cloud Operating Model in accordance with the characteristics of video conferencing with frequent demand fluctuations and variable usage patterns and high network occupancy, the request can be flexibly adjusted.Mobility and video conferencing solutions require that if you need to stability, you should also select a hyper-scale client. Before you have to review the overview of cloud native technologies and operational models, the overall features of the cloud platform are thoroughly reviewed to clearly set the expectation. An important part of the Mobility supports the mobility that it does not forget that the utilization of the mobile device is not increased.In order to support mobile devices, it is priority to solve not only the existing applications, but also to the massive technical liabilities of new business applications (general technology, UX, UI, design, and manuals). all. Virtual Desktop and Remote Management Support Virtual Desktop or Virtualization Solution is a tool that IT administrators are separated from the environment where the Physical Desktop Systems are separated from the environment used by the Personal Desktop System, which is the most important aspect to enable remote operation.Individuals access their work applications and documents and allow them to maintain connections in any position. So far, there were many cases provided as a corporate data center service, but it has already developed a lot of cloud-based desktop virtualization technologies and provides more reliable expansion than existing data center solutions. 18 Digital Services Issues La.Disaster Recovery and Business Persistence Support A cloud-based failover solution that supports fast system recovery when an unexpected failure occurs, not only to pay for costs as much as possible, but also costs, but also consumer entities and services Providing a variety of options to provide a variety of options to ensure the sustainability of business critical work as much as possible.Only 12% of Gartner's 'business continuity' webinar participant was normal for business operations due to corona -19. In other words, even if this number is representing the company's cloud conversion rate, there is no big crowd. The fact that the work environment is being reproduced and managed in many places, the cloud is essentially resilient and ensures larger resource availability than most common data centers can support. mind.The application's extensibility support application can quickly and simply add computing resources to meet the increase in demand as needed. The demand for these scalability has contributed greatly to the enterprise to convert data center applications to the cloud platform, and the change in this IT operating model has secured business cases that increase the reliability of the cloud platform.The cloud is recognized as a preferred environment for hosting enterprise applications that have a variety of usage or extended requirements. In accenture, the \"scalable\" of the \"cloud value of the cloud value),\" scalability \"was also called the value of the most important cloud. Cloud Solution Selection Tendency The choice of the cloud market is to show that the tendency to form the mainstream is that the company has been a special interest in the top executives.Of course, in 2020, the tendency was clear, especially, especially in Asia, new technologies are being introduced and attempted. As shown in Figure 517, according to the irradiation of the action, it was shown that more than 90% of the leaders in the Asia Pacific region are more actively approaching and interested in the cloud opportunities. In particular, the interests of these leaders are very uniquely distributed to all cloud technologies. It is a part that is very consent to our company.15) Gartner,Gartner Business Continuity Survey Shows Just 12 Percent of Organizations Are Highly  Prepared for Coronavirus‚Äù, Mar 10, 2020 16) Accenture Article, Kunal Shah, Yaron Raps, ‚ÄúCloud adoption settosoar in emerging markets‚Äù,  Sep 21, 2020 17 ) Accenture Future Systems Research Study, 2019 19 Digital Service Issue Report Figure 5 Asian Company Cloud Technology Introduction (Source: Accenture Future Systems Research Study, 2019) So how do you look at four typical trends Let's see. go. Corporate cloud solution selection criteria are becoming very wise. Until 2019, the best leadership team to choose a cloud solution was very ambiguous.It is true that the conversion of the cloud to the cloud has begun the transition project that the business of the business can be enormously improved, and that the results of the business can be improved enormously. Changes in 2020 are now that only the best leadership is no longer a decision, and are involved in the workings of practice.In addition to the business practitioners in the enterprise, we have established the best conversion plan for companies, along with the experts in the market, and in the choice point, the selection of business goals and realistic expectations in the selection point, and the agility and recovery resilience (Resiliency) will be discussed first. Of course, it is also necessary to analyze the current asset operations, but also analyzes the current asset operations and compares the comparison of cloud introduction costs compared to total cost of ownership (TCO) and investor 'According to Gartner Survey 18), the cost of the initial cloud conversion contrast compared to the OFREMIS emphasizes that it should be steadily working on operating methods and learning for cost savings. As shown in Figure 6, it is generally an effect of saving 55% of total cost of ownership over three years. 18) Gartner Research, Marco Meinardi, \"How to Developa Business Case for the Adoption of Public Cloud IaaS\", NOV 21, 2018 20 Digital Service Issue Liport Figure 6 Yes, I am a three-year cloud conversion cost Yes. The concept is expanding while the hybrid cloud led the market.The hybrid cloud model with the concept divided into the public and private cloud is evolving. As shown in Figure 7, it is replaced by a hybrid IT model that manages and integrates several existing assets, not only a cloud environment (on-handmion, hosting service, non-cloud), not only a plurality of public cloud and private clouds.Figure 7 The evolution of the hybrid cloud model The new hybrid model is much more complex because it contains five evolved concepts, but it is necessary to recognize that this itself is consistent with the goal of the digital transformation.21 Digital Services Issue Report ‚ë† Location: Integrating cloud services that operate in other physical locations in the enterprise ‚ë° Technology (Technology): Integrate Heterogeneous Hardware / Software Technology (Control): Control: Multiple Physical Abstract Management Federation ‚ë£ Ownership: Share and manage integrated services ‚ë§ Operating Model: Public, Private,The new solutions that respond to the hybrid model of this evolved concept, such as Operational Model, etc., are emerging in the market under the name \"packaged hybrid cloud\". It is a technique that provides a separate entity into a separate entity and provides a separate entity into a separate entity.Depending on the entity model that you provide, it can be divided into two types, and it is a software container as a software container, such as a product line that has been packaged again to its public model, such as AWS or Microsoft solution, and multiple cloud platforms There is a solution that will work on.(Figure 8) Figure 8 Package Hybrid Cloud Perhaps a company with a company with existing assets can be achieved, which can solve the most worrying part while converting clouds, and the market is responding quickly. 22 Digital Service Issue Floor. The conversion to the multi-cloud model is fast. The goal of starting the cloud switching is that the business process and operation could make 'simple and simple', and it was true that the single cloud strategy was popular accordingly.Over the past 1 to 2 years, the \"Cloud Operation model was based on the business strategy and reality of the company, and that everything was impossible to get everything from a single cloud supplier. Corporate can use multi-cloud environments to distribute computing resources and minimize downtime and data loss risk.Computing performance and storage can be flexible and can be flexibly, all of the suppliers do not have to flexibly and use the best-of-breed function and use it to the best of business performance. In addition to the switching of the hybrid model described above, most recent corporate cloud selection options are mostly a multi-cloud strategy. Despite a variety of advantages of multi-cloud operations models, there are many relative disadvantages to be considered in advance compared to single Clam.Table 1 below summarizes the relative disadvantages of multi-cloud and the relative advantages of a single cloud. Multi-cloud single cloud √ø can be dangerous. Risk √ø Complexity decreases. ≈∏ Do not lock-in to the supplier. Costs √ø Operating costs, management costs increase. ≈∏ Volume discount when purchasing is possible. ≈∏ Cross-platform development / operating technology requires a description of the requirements √ø Can only focus on a single platform / required. ≈∏ Platform-only operational tools without additional costs. Multi-Cloud Support Tools are required. It is possible as a tool.≈∏ You need to create an application that meets the cloud. ≈∏ Applications for the cloud-only application are easy to create and manage similar kinds of applications. Sean increases. Table 1 Considerations when selecting multi-cloud operational models 23 Digital service Issueropla. Bimodal cloud strategy is shown by ordering two rabbits.If the initial cloud model reports a new IT potential, it is now evolving into a approach that is a bimmark that focuses on new business possibilities based on the technology. The bimodal is two separate, but it is a way to manage a consistent task method, and the first mode is mainly valuable for the stability and sustainability of the current state, and the next mode focuses on the future value of predictable.As shown in Fig. Figure 9 Biotic Mark Approach for Cloud Evolution The important point is that IT work ability and business profit should grow and innovation. It is recommended that you set up the target and the business part of the IT part and the business part, as in the example of Table 2 below.24 Digital Service Issue Report IT Profit / Benefits Business Profit / Benefits √ø IT Cost Reduction Ability √ø Increase in sales and improving profitability √ø Improved transparency for IT costs.≈∏ Quick reactivity to changes that appear in the market √ø New projects and prototypes of new projects and prototypes without having to wait for the next release cycle √ø Improvement of customer satisfaction √ø Improved customer satisfaction √ø Improved IT availability and recovery elasticity √ø Improved productivity √ø Improved responsivability for scalability requirements √ø Ability to support new business initiatives √ø Features that can be reassigned to IT workforce to other projects √ø Ease of new global regional ease of operation Table 2 Examples of Biomel's targetsThe tendency of branches is a very clear flow in the corporate cloud solution market, but in addition to this, edge computing and distributed cloud models are also actively discussed and experimented. But the important point is that all these technologies and operations tendencies are not sufficiently verified in effects and productivity.According to McKinsee report, only 14% of the company's leading businesses in the progress of the DT has been in the meantime, and it would be said that it will experience a more distinctive effect when it is at the end of 2021. Finishing Many new technologies and mature technologies will help them to convert clouds to support the highest performance of business business.To be experienced with such a technique and operation, it is necessary to practice the IT result profit and business results with a reasonable target by using the same method before the introduction of technology. It is also necessary to effort of proficient engineers in various cloud technologies. This practice and effort should be based on the innovative consequences and can select a cloud technology provider or partner to create a successful digital conversion.The goal of the transition to the corporate cloud is to change the existing assets currently used to move or change to the cloud, but to a much more intelligent company ultimately. Using new IT technologies to create new business values ‚Äã‚Äãshould be the final goal. 19) McKinsey Article - Jayne Giemzo, Mark Gu, James Kaplan, Lars Vinter, \"How CIO Sand CTO Scan Accelerate Digital Transformations Through Cloud Platforms\", SEP 15, 2020 25 Digital Services Issue Lipott 04 CES 2021 The CES 2021 events that the Editor's Community Technology Association (CTA) was subject to the CES 2021 events.Due to the unprecedented Corona-19 shares, the first 100% of the elderly were carried out. More than 1,900 visions have participated in this year, covering a wide range of technical spectrum, and the conference sessions that can hear a vision for a better future from industry leaders are available. Official events are on Thursday, January 11 to 14, as the United States, but approaches to digital platforms and on-demand content are from February 15th.Gary Shapiro (Gary Shapiro) CTA President and CEO said, \"There was a way to innovate the world's technology community in the world, devoted by the existing CES due to CES due to pan demic. CES has a new look this year, but its basis is still rooted in innovation, connection and collaboration. Digital innovation will continue for several years even if CES returns to Las Vessel in 2022. This year I found the value of a digital connection through CES. It is very welcomed that the world that could not be participated in CES in physical is digitally gathered.\"He said. Corona -19 with 100% Digital Events CES 2021 introduced innovation and products across a wide range of technologies from automobiles to digital health, 5G and Smart City. On Monday, Monday, Monday, on Monday, on media data, on the media data, opened about 20 reporter's conferences around the world, and innovation in sustainable products, transportation and mobility We introduced the same CES 2021 trends and themes in advance.As 100% digital event, the site development and operation were the most important. The cloud partner of this event is Microsoft. Micro Soft's gorgeous cloud infrastructure enabled everyone to participate in all over the world. If you have announcing a discussion keynote other than a company alone, you have used Microsoft Collaboration, Microsoft Teams, a Software As A SaaS (Software As A SaaS (Software As AS), if you have a conference. A query response or a real-time reporter meeting was also provided.Related announcement images were supported with 17 language subtitles. Hangul translation was still very improved and the first time, it was not inserted in the image processing sector. Because of buffering, immersion was not done. CTAs and many companies have supported 26 digital service issue-to-a-time customers who have not registered 26 digital service issues through how to simultaneously send on YouTube.The CTA said that it is a situation in the US Las Vegas, as scheduled for the coming 2022, but it is a situation where Corona confirmed is a surge in the winter, but the vaccine came out, but for group immunity, it is not enough to raise up to 60% of the entire population. 100% Digital will end up with this one, but it is a high probability of meeting 100% digital in 2022. It is already expected how much improvement of the following year.Many discussions have been made to see how much the world is changing, and how quickly the world is changing, and how much the world is changing. (Figure 10) Figure 10 Digital acceptance caused by Corona -19 Digital acceptance CTA Steve Kornig (VP) and Lesley Rohrbaugh Rohrbaugh Rohrbaugh (LESLEY ROHRBAUGH) Research Director In trends, US Consumer Technology Sales & Forecasts (US Consumer Technology Sales & Forecasts) were released exclusively dictionary.20) According to this data, Technology Industry Retail Sales sales in the United States will increase by 4.3% per year and in 2021, as well as $ 4,61 billion, as well as a streaming service, depending on the technology, 5G Connectivity and Digital Health Devices are expected to be prompt in the field of 2021. 20) 2021 Tech Trand 27 Digital Service Issue Lipot The time you send at home, and you are using more time and cost to the game or online streaming service, as you increase the time you send at home.Game app downloads increased by more than 30% annually, and 45% of consumers are using more online streaming services at home .21) Cloud and artificial intelligence role The Dsni Plus, which is a new OTT service, Disney Plus, In early October, subscribers have revealed 73.7 million. Disney was expected to reach 60 million to 90 million people by 2024 at the time of the new plus. However, thanks to the impact of corona-19 influence and cloud infrastructure, we have reached a three-year goal in one year.This can be confirmed by Netflix to secure a subscribers who have been secured in seven years to secure a subscriber in just five months, and how strong the aftermath of Corona -19 is. The basal of these changes is the evaluation of experts that there is cloud and artificial intelligence. Michael Miebach Master Card CEO and Julie Sweet (Julie Sweet) Access (Julie Sweet) Acceptance CEO, especially emphasized this point. The US e-commerce scale quickly increased.The US has increased by 31.8% higher than that of the US $ 111.5 billion (251.2 billion won) (251.2 billion won) (251.2 billion won) (190 trillion won). According to the US Top of the US, the total amount of retail sales in 3Q02 was predicted at $ 1.468.9 billion, and the total sales of e-commerce sales accounted for 14.3% of total sales. This is a 36.7% increase from e-commerce sales in 3Q19 .22) Michael Mi Bark Master Card CEO said, \"1 year ago, US e-commerce proportion was about 13% of total retail trading. However, it became 20% in one year.Digital payment tools were available, and cloud-based e-commerce services have been able to respond well for the stomach of online consumption. \" Julie Suites Access CEO is \"There are two important factors in terms of technology, but it is cloud and artificial intelligence. Even before Corona, cloud conversion was an issue, but this rate was very fast. We witnessed things that will be held in just two or a year for ten years for ten years.If the current cloud introduction is 20%, it is observed to reach 80% of large companies in 2025. The cloud is not able to miss the cloud with a digital age Global Business Platform. \" (Fig. 11) 21) Mckinsey, Meet the Next Normal Consumer, April 2020 22) https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf 28 Digital Service Issue Report Figure 11 US Open The proportion of e-commerce among the 3Q07 retails, which also emphasized the role of artificial intelligence.\"In situations where numerous problems such as supply chain disorders, consumer behavioral change, data umplos, the artificial intelligence is increasing and predicting various kinds of business and predictions, and it is possible to respond to preemptive simulations. As the role of the public part becomes bigger, the role of artificial intelligence is great for automation to communicate with many citizens and communication. \" Both CEOs emphasized that it is important to this vessel.The width, depth, speed, and culture of digital adoption is important than anything else. Corona Former Accommodation has investigated 10 industries around the world and 8,000 companies, but the top 10% of the world had doubled higher achievements than a lower 25% corporation. Depending on which leadership, you can point to the competitive advantage day in this vessel. This is a description that is not a simple technique issue.The role of the leader is important to use the cloud and an artificial intelligence infrastructure to the existing business, or how to use it in a new business, and the role of the leader to use it, and these leaders are the market and consumers, I said it should be particularly attention. One of the ridicules in this event was the Alazon and Google's moving. The most optimized companies on digital have occurred an ironic situation that has not been involved properly on the event that has been 100% digital.In recent 3-4 years, the invisible protagonist of the CES event was Amazon and Google. In 2017, the Amazon AI secretary, Alexa and its appliance, and APIs, were able to meet a number of instruments that have been attached to the Mark of 'Built-in Amazon' in the 2020 CES events. The first participating in CES in 2018 showed that 2019, participating in the 2019, the Avivisuality of Amazon and the Artificial Intelligence Secretary was sold out in the confrontation of the Amazon and Artificial Intelligence Secretary. I attracted many of them with Google's chase to catch the prior to Amazon.Samsung Electronics or LG Electronics also had a spirit of Claude-based artificial intelligence secretar service called Bigsby and Thinky. Both other household appliances, all over the world's start-up or health care companies, as well as the work of speech recognition secretars based on cloud-based infrastructures. But in this CES, 'Built-in Amazon, Built-in Google' was hard to find.Although housebye companies have used experience of experienced booths after announcement, we did not invest in a set of innovative VR and AR in digital converted situations. If you use the appliances to maximize the immersion, you will not be able to be a preliminary situation when the event is also digital. LG Electronics Think 'Open Innovation' was a LG Thinq (LG Thinq) that was evolving as an intelligent lifestyle platform 'app'.LG Electronics has cooperated with open innovation and has been working with a variety of partners to expand the platform ecological system of LG Think Apps. This app simply allows customers to enjoy their daily life more conveniently, crossing the level of controlling household appliances. LG Electronics announced that customers work with Nestle, Kraft-Heinz, a global food company to allow food to purchase foods using LG Think Apps. Shooting the barcode of food ordered with smartphones also introduced the 'Scan-to-Cook (domestic name: Artificial Intelligence Cook) feature to find the optimal recipes.In addition, LG Electronics has been in partnership with Homeadvisor, a homepaudvisor, and a service to apply for installing the household appliances in the house in the LG Think Apps. The LG Think Apps is constantly evolving, such as adding a Proactive Customer Care, which is optimally controlled by the home appliance in 2020, and has a new service based on customer value. The production service is based on artificial intelligence technology, analyzing the operating status of the product, and informs you in advance.LG Electronics has built-in wireless LAN chips to most household appliances that are released since 2020 and can be monitored by one of them. In the case of washing machines, we are also able to identify the type and weight of the laundry and the weight, etc., allow the water to be used at least in advance, or prior to failing before failing. LG Electronics CTO, Park, said he said he would be more sold to Open Innovation through Open Partnership. The event was a close view of how humanity corresponds to Corona-on-19 era.Corona-19 30 Digital Services The diverse devices and digital health areas needed to be the most recent in the era of Digital Services. It is also emphasized that Corona-19 vaccine development, mask, and disaster product are also used for production. AMD CEO, a keynote speech, AMD CEO, \"AMD's participation in AMD, AMD EPYC process and 12 Peterfal's computing power supported by AMD Radeon Instincts, including Corona -19 I have contributed to the epidemic study, \"he said.In front of a major, the cloud and artificial intelligence are helping to prepare a breakthrough. This event was a place to identify such a cross section.\n",

The essentials of choosing an EPI to find the best in 6 compromised points between the highest level of security required and the best possible comfort in the execution of the task. PPEs, products not like the other 1 the notion of personal protective equipment (PPE) agrees if the products comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/425 and one or more EPI standards. To be effective, an EPI must be worn. This means that it must be accepted by the user and not hindering it in achieving his task. The design and use of PPEs have standardized in the twentieth century. As early as the 1970s, their use was introduced into the Labor Code. User Directives (No. 89/391 / EEC), (No. 89/656 / EEC) and Design (No. 86/686 / EEC) are created by the European Union. These texts are adapted and integrated into the legislations of the European states. In the 1980s, the manufacture of PPEs moves outside Europe. Increased harmonization becomes necessary. Regulation (EU) 2016/425 repeals and replaces, in 2018, Directive No. 86/686 / EEC on the design of PPE. The same rules apply immediately in all states.EPI standards are attached. Jointly established by manufacturers, notified bodies, occupational health agencies gathered in standardization committees under the CEN, European Standards Committee, they are regularly revised. The conformity of an EPI to an EPI standard gives it a presumption of compliance with the EPI Regulation and therefore the essential requirements of health and safety. The PPE also obey the REACH regulation entered into force on June 1, 2007. This text controls the use of chemicals in the manufacture of all products to prohibit the use of health and environmental substances. Environment. A good understanding of the rules of manufacture and use of PPEs is essential to understand and know the responsibilities of all actors, from the manufacturer to the user. The IPI Manufacturing Rules 3 The IPI design and manufacturing rules are contained in Regulation (EU) 2016/425. This defines the EPI product, the design and manufacturing processes, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the actors of the production and distribution chain. 1- 4 PPEs are classified into 3 categories Class I examples These are the products that protect against low risk household gloves, cotton cleaning gloves.likely to cause super fiber lesions, easily perceived by the user. Category II According to the Regulations, all products are not found in helmets and safety glasses are Category II Category I or III PPE. Category III These are the products that protect against the risks likely to the respiratory protection masks, the hearing protections to cause irreversible or fatal injuries. And the fall arrest are Category III IPIs This ranking is used to determine Certification and PPE control rules: The higher the risk, the more reinforced they are. Import 2-for Category II and III PPE, the conformity of a distribution product to standards and regulations is verified by States at the manufacturer The distributor designs, manufactures provides through the notified bodies for PPE. and controls the products and for category II, certification is carried out from production. Orients customers. Type product. For Category III, it is carried out by a permanent control of production vis-√†-vis the standard product. 3-EPIs must be marked. The marking must include the regulation the identification of the manufacturer, traceability, standards and (EU) 2016/425. levels of protection claimed.Each sold EPI must always be accompanied by a user manual. If the PPE complies with the EPI Regulation and a notified testing and controls Norm EPI products, the CE marking can be affixed. To verify their compliance the customer chooses his to the EPI standards and the regulations. Protection adapted to the risks encountered.

It relies on Directive 89/391 / EEC in principle prevention and approach in principle to avoid risks. 1- 6 EPIs are put in place if, and only if, collective security means are insufficient. An employer must adopt a single prevention approach: delete the avoidable risks, then assess the inevitable risks and respond with even collective ways and then individual. 2- Employers are responsible for the choice of PPEs and their adequacy to the risks encountered by their employees. 3- EPI carriers must be trained at the port of these products.

Regulation Assessing risks, you offer adapted protection and customize it The normative system of head protection is based on two standards are part of our business. Main that define cap and protective helmet. 4 Protective helmets are subject to several standards when they protect combined risks. The work in height: the standard EN 12492: 2012 The standard, EN 12492: 2012 defines the minimum safety requirements and test methods for mountaineering helmets. The helmet must meet more important design and performance requirements, including shock absorption and penetration during lateral impacts. The resistance of the jugular passes from 25 to 50 newtons with 4 anchor points, which limits the risk of loss of the helmet in case of fall. Some helmets simultaneously respond to both standards in 397 + A1: 2012 and 12492: 2012.The electrical risk: the EN 50365: 2002 standard used in addition to EN 397 + A1: 2012, EN 50365: 2002 defines headsets that offer electrical insulation to work near low-voltage installations. They protect, in the presence of current up to 1000V alternative or 1500V continuously, preventing the passage of the current through the head. The helmets must be used with other protections against electrical risk. I choose my equipment Caps protects caps protect against shocks, outdoors, without risk of object drop above the wearer. They are also widely used indoors, for accidental shocks and cuts by building occupations such as plumbers, electricians, tilers and also in industry, on the production lines or drivers. Lighter than helmets, often more airy, they are more easily accepted and worn. The mention \"Attention, this is not a protective helmet\" must appear on the cap of the cap. Indeed, the protection cap does not protect against falls. 27 Cap The protective helmets helmets protect against objects.Cap with strap They consist of two parts: damping S ‚Ä¢ The cap consisting of a lightweight and resistant material for I a N Napper withstand shocks and perforations.

Our experts are at your disposal to seek, with you, the hearing protection solution most adapted to your risks, your activities and your budget. I identify potential risks What is noise? To simplify, the noise is an unwanted sound, harmful beyond 80 dB. There are two types of noise. The first is the general ambient noise, like the one heard in the workplaces. The second is the impact noise, a unique and intense sound similar to an explosion. The noise measurement Exposure to noise is measured. Its health impact depends on three factors.The intensity of the noise is the sound level, it is measured in decibel. An increase of 3 dB corresponds to a doubling of a source of the same intensity (for example, from one to two cars that produce a sound of 60 dB ends at 63 dB). To couple the notions of sound intensity and exposure time, two regulatory measures have been created: ‚Ä¢ The decibels weighted on a working day of 8h = dB (a). ‚Ä¢ The weighted decibels of PICS = DB (C). The legal limitations of exposure are: 87 dB noise exposure level (A) or 140 dB peak acoustic pressure level (C). What are the risks generated by the noise? Punctual exhibition Chronic exhibition no little intense sound ‚Ä¢ stress ‚Ä¢ anxiety, depression, irritability but repeated ‚Ä¢ sleep disorders, insomnia ‚Ä¢ Cardiovascular disorders Intense sound level ‚Ä¢ F Atigue Hearing ‚Ä¢ Accident at work> 80 dB ‚Ä¢ Tinnitus ‚Ä¢ Tinnitus ‚Ä¢ Hearing deficit Temporary ‚Ä¢ Permanent Hearing Deficit ‚Ä¢ Deafness Sound Level Very Intense ‚Ä¢ Immediate Deafness ‚Ä¢ Deafness> 135 dB Noise exposure can have two types of health effects: hearing aids as non-hearing. The consequences of noiseless exposure can be immediate as progressive.When serious consequences appear, it is often too late to react: the lesions caused by the noise exposure on the audition are irreversible. 47 Measures the protection levels needed How to guarding the noise? Beyond 75 dB, protection beyond 87 dB (a) on one day of 8h, exposure beyond 140 dB, noise exposure is prohibited, hearing is prohibited: it The exposure must be limited in the same with the port of protectors: attenuating noise. time. It is necessary to reduce or delete the exposure. The EN 458: 2016 standard determines the method of exposure prevention to noise risk: ‚Ä¢ measure noise exposure, exposure time and calculate individual daily exposure. ‚Ä¢ Reduce exposure to noise by methods other than personal protection. ‚Ä¢ Set up personal protection: Identify areas in which individual protection is essential, then choose a protector. ‚Ä¢ Extreme levels may require double protection as well as technical or administrative controls. 87 dB vle * 60 dB 65 dB 70 dB 75 dB 80 dB 85 dB 90 dB Protection lens: excessive protection: the carrier with the protector, the protector must not feel isolated carrier protection must hear protection phonally.Acceptable These Sound Levels Acceptable Insuf Fifting Protection Exposure to Noise Forbidden * Exposure limit value to be effective, hearing protection must be worn for the duration of exposure to noise. Use at 100% Use at 99% Use at 90% Gives protection five minutes of negligence per day virtually no desired considerably reduces the ef fi ciency of hearing protection Factors that prevent optimal protection: ‚Ä¢ Lack of training: It is necessary to remove about 5 dB from the protectors when carried by unforced persons, and 10 dB in the event of an earplug port ‚Ä¢ the simultaneous port of other protective elements, the inadequacy of the protector to the morphology From the wearer ‚Ä¢ The frequent removal of the protector ‚Ä¢ The degradation of the protector (aging, dirt) The training, the awareness of the exposed persons and the choice of protectors adapted to the wearer and at risk are determining factors to ensure an optimized level of protection. How to determine my level of attenuation? - Level of attenuation = surround sound level Exposure Level of auditory protection Noise is indicated on the Protector in SNR: Reminder: must be less than 87 dB (a) it represents the level of attenuation on a day of 8h . in dB of the protector.Objective: 70 to 75 dB (a) www.groupe-rg.com 48 General Catalog The performance of hearing protection is indicated on all protectors using the SNR (Single Number Rating): it's a harmonized measurement that makes it easy to compare the protectors. Manufacturers detail the notices accurate attenuations measured by frequency. Thus, when a chainsaw user emitting a noise of 100 dB (A) for 8 hours must choose his hearing protection, he necessarily chooses a protection of 33 dB SNR to pass below the maximum exposure threshold.Handwood Hand Sawing Forklift Noise Ladder Circular Saw Generator Hammer Vacuum Cleaner Chainsaw Tutor Whispers Conversation Bulldozer Explosion Breathing Dynamite Driver DB (A) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Hearing Threshold Threshold of Pain SNR 20 dB <SNR 25 dB <SNR SNR Exposure Recommended Attenuation <20 dB <25 dB <30 dB> 30db Forbidden 87 dB (A) on 8h 140 dB Legal Obligations 80 dB (A) on 8h Exposure Threshold Limit Exposure not to exceed with compulsory protector of protector beyond: Exhibition forbidden 85 dB (a) over 8h port of the mandatory protector I choose the comfort of my equipment plugs plugs plugs hoop helmet shells headphone headphones Wireless anti-mouldable anti-mounted anti-mounted reusable sound molded sounds The choice between plugs and headphones is often a matter of person preference she.

The view is one of the meanings we give most importance. I identify in order to preserve it, the innovations The risks I measure proposed by the manufacturers have no potential the levels I chosen missed. Branch glasses, goggles - protective masks and facial screens have been needed from my imagined for decades. Their materials, their forms adapted to one or more risks are determined by a normative system that evolves according to the technical advances and the improvement of the protection capacities of the PPE.I identify the potential risks The standard in 166: 2001, the basic standard of the risk of thermal mechanical ocular hazards The basic standard of glasses risks of protection is the standard in 166: optical chemicals 2001.

To avoid having to frequently remove protection, the manufacturers have invented variable hue welding masks, whose requirements are specified in the EN 379 + A1: 2009 standard. The filters automatically switch to change the color of the screen. When booting the welding, without the need for the filter adjustment from the wearer. Some of these hoods also combine respiratory protection in order to protect themselves from the vapors of the weld.

You have to protect yourself. Aerosols The gases there are two types: can be very dangerous, especially when they ‚Ä¢ solid and smoke aerosols: different dust are not detectable by man. Mineral materials, pollen, microbes, viruses, etc. ‚Ä¢ Liquid aerosols, called mists: liquids, chemicals, etc. Vapors The lack of oxygen: anoxia like certain gases, some vapors (obtained by the air we breathe daily is composed of: evaporation of solid or liquids at room temperature) ‚Ä¢ 21% oxygen / 78% Nitrogen / 1% rare gas can not be filtered or in temporalities very we need a minimum of 19.5% short oxygen. to survive. Below, the risk of anoxia is dangerous or even fatal in some cases. See the ED6126 record of INRS. Www.groupe-rg.com 104 General Catalog Regulation The contribution of the group RG 4 in accordance with the applicable legislation, these we propose a comprehensive solution to Category III PPEs.Protectors require monitoring in control, EPI + Service = We are at your side on the life cycle maintenance and maintenance. complete product. 5 Respiratory protections are Category III PPEs. Approved training organization, we form the use and port of PPE in con fi bed spaces. Maintenance in our workshops or traveling, we know how to intervene as close to your facilities through our 7 Category III EPI centers. How to assess the risk generated by a pollutant for humans? The nature of the pollutants they are in the form of gas, aerosols or vapors, the different toxic pollutants cause effects on human health. 1. Any discomfort 3. Caling lung damage, heart, brain 2. Allergens or causes irritation 4. Fortal or caused irreversible damage The particle size This scale makes it possible to give an idea about the sizes of the particles that can be met. Dust Virus Smoked Bacteria Fibers Mineral Hair 0.01-0.1Œº 0.5Œº 1Œº 5Œº 10Œº 100Œº I measure the protection levels necessary The duration of exposure and the concentration of pollutants The concentration of pollutants in the air and duration of Exhibition are two determining criteria in risk assessment for humans.The more a pollutant is concentrated, the higher the risk, and the more risk-free exposure time is reduced. The Ministry of Labor has set the concentration limit values ‚Äã‚Äãat workplaces by type of pollutant. These values ‚Äã‚Äãmust be consulted (INRS notice Ed 6106 and https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/img/pdf/rapport-scola-vlep-2018.pdf) to find the appropriate protection. VLEP: VLEP CT: Occupational Exposure Limit Value Short-term limit Exposure for a working day of 8h maximum concentration to which and a week of 40h for which the exhibition A person can be exposed without daily risk represents no risk for health. for 15 min. 105 pollutants in our body The effects of pollutants on the human body pollutants, according to their nature, can penetrate 1 da dust the human body by inhalation, orally and b smoke sometimes also by dermal path through c fogs or aerosols eyes and the skin. D gas and vapors Certain pollutants cause acute and immediate crises, others chronic poisoning: 1 brain 2 gravity is to be taken seriously in all cases. 2 pharynx B C 3 bronchioles 4 lungs 5 ‚Äã‚Äãliver and stomach The gas detection The gas detector controls the quality of the air in the 3 4 work area. It controls the oxygen level and detects gases a C b harnesses or explosives.A visual and sound alarm snaps into place if a pollutant gas reaches a dangerous concentration or if oxygen drops below a certain limit. The detectors can be mobile or fixed. The concentration of a gas in the air is measured in ppm: part per million. The detector indicates the VLE and the VME of the gas detected in ppm. 5 5 of RG Group Category III EPI centers are suitable for you to help you find the sensing solution adapted to your needs. I choose my respiratory protection device Respiratory protections respond to Regulation (EU) 425/2016, Category III PPEs subjected to a strict and independent production control of the manufacturer. The 3-step prevention approach 1 Select the appropriate respiratory protection apparatus a. Identify the type of pollutant and its exact nature. b.

(If the pollutant penetrates the skin: see page 278 on disposable combinations and page 86 on masks). vs. Evaluate the concentration and duration of exposure. d. Select the protective device and filter if necessary. 2 Form the carrier to use its respiratory protection apparatus. 3 Check whenever necessary the integrity of the respiratory protection device by ensuring the necessary maintenance. Www.groupe-rg.Com 106 General catalog What protector choosing? This decision tree gives you the first indications for determining the type of respiratory protection needed. It is built from the nature of the pollutant and the duration of risk exposure. RG Group III Category III Centers are at your disposal to conduct in-depth risk studies.

They are marked R. Conversely, the masks marked Nr must be thrown at the end of a workstation. The half-masks and comprehensive masks it is, most often, reusable respiratory protectors that can be cleaned and whose filters can be changed. Depending on the type of filter, the half-masks and complete masks constitute a protection against the particles, the half-mask mask complete gas, vapors or against a combination of these less bulky, eye protection risks.CAUTION, some fi lters marked Nr no longer light. and the face, indispensable are neither washable nor reusable: it is imperative when the pollutant can penetrate by the eyes consult the notice beforehand. and the skin. The active filtration (or positive pressure): the breathing force provided by the carrier is diminished or zero an active respirator provides the carrier the air fi liltered directly into the facial piece (mask or hood) by the ringed pipe. It offers usually motorized respiratory assistance. These devices are recommended for prolonged use or in dif fi cable conditions. Depending on the filter used, these respiratory protectors can protect from all types of pollutants. On the other hand, they should not be used under conditions presenting an immediate danger for life or health (DIVS). The choice of these protectors is a risk study; Consult our experts or our Category III EPI centers. The assisted ventilation (VA) These respiratory protection systems use a motor to provide aircrafts with fixed cartridges, engine, belt or back. The air is reinjected by a motor, operating on batteries, in facial piece Respiratory pipe filter unit The facial piece via a respiratory pipe. They allow great mobility. Www.groupe-rg.COM 108 General Catalog The filters The aerosol and dust filters there are 3 classes of aerosol and dust filters. They work like sieve and filter more and more fine particles or more effectively. A marked filter R is reusable according to certain conditions described in the instructions, a labeled filter Nr is not. The marking D corresponds to an additional optional test for disposable masks, mandatory for filters, clogging with dolomite dust. When using, the filter is gradually saturated. The filter becomes resistant to the passage of air, with a risk of leakage. From the first signs of respiratory embarrassment, the filter must be changed.FFP1 or P1 FFP2 or P2 FFP3 or P3 Mask for FNP * FNP 4 Welding for a disposable mask FNP 12 for a disposable mask FNP 50 for a disposable mask FNP 10 and half-mask and half-mask FNP 48 for a Half mask FNP 5 for a full mask FNP 16 for a complete mask FNP 1000 for a complete mask Capacity Low levels of fine dust levels moderate levels of high levels of fine dust moderated levels of fine filtration dust (up to 4 x the VME) and thin mists (up to 10 x the VME) and (up to 50 x the VME) and mists (up to 10 x the VME), aqueous or oily mists generally aqueous watery mists or oily generally aqueous or oily, fumes from sandblasting operations, usually from operations of handling metal toxic powders, ozone or drilling and cutting vapors. plastering, cementage, sanding present in the organic pharmaceutical industry generally derived and dust of soft wood. or tasks involving welding and brazing agents. biological and fiber.Transmitter ‚Ä¢ Brick ‚Ä¢ Concrete ‚Ä¢ Asbestos of pollutants ‚Ä¢ Limestone ‚Ä¢ PARPAING ‚Ä¢ Hardwood or exotic ‚Ä¢ Cellulose ‚Ä¢ Tender wood ‚Ä¢ Filter ceramic ‚Ä¢ Cotton ‚Ä¢ Iron ‚Ä¢ Granite ‚Ä¢ Charcoal ‚Ä¢ Glass fibers, ‚Ä¢ Cadmium ‚Ä¢ Cement ‚Ä¢ Rock wool ‚Ä¢ Chrome ‚Ä¢ Flour ‚Ä¢ Welding fumes ‚Ä¢ Lead ‚Ä¢ Hay ‚Ä¢ Nickel ‚Ä¢ Silica ‚Ä¢ Stone ‚Ä¢ Zinc oxide ‚Ä¢ Legionelle (<2 hours of intervention). ‚Ä¢ Plaster ‚Ä¢ Bacteria ‚Ä¢ Pollen ‚Ä¢ Mushrooms CAUTION, if respiratory protection ‚Ä¢ FFP3 virus is suitable for filtering asbestos dust, from a certain concentration rate, a disposable mask will soon be inoperative: prefer a half-mask, See a complete mask with assisted ventilation. * Nominal Protection Factor (FNP): Minimum Protection Level of a Mask Depending on Laboratory Performance The Gas and Vapor Filters The gas and vapor filters use activated carbon to retain harmful gases. Once the charcoal is saturated, no molecule can be captured and the filter no longer has its filter power. The nature of the gas, its concentration in the air and the necessary time of filtration are decisive for choosing the adapted filter and its volume.When long work in dangerous atmosphere are essential, it is necessary to calculate the chatting time of the filter (the moment when it becomes inefficient) by an expert. According to EN 14387 + A1: 2008, their durability ranges from 20 minutes to about 70 minutes into non-saturated atmosphere.

They isolate the carrier of the external atmosphere and provide non-contaminated air. Compressed air supply systems are non-autonomous respiratory devices. The non-contaminated air that is supplied to the carrier comes from either an external air network or compressed air bottles. Autonomous device or not, the choice of the respiratory device depends on the conditions of use and activities. Non-autonomous insulating devices: air supply air comes from a compressor or bottles. It is distributed to the facial room via a respiratory pipe, after having been facial piece Respiratory pipe regulator adapted to human respiration by a regulator purifier. The breathable air supply is ‚Ä¢ constant flow ‚Ä¢ flow at unlimited demand.The air continues in the facial room.

With this type of respiratory protection, the ambient air is sucked by a motorized ventilation device equipped with a battery. The contaminated air passes through respiratory protection filters in which particles, gases or vapors are filtered.Thanks to the engine, the purified air is brought to the head part by a respiratory pipe, which allows the user to breathe clean air. The respiratory resistance that does not increase, allows prolonged and more comfortable use. Integrated with the mask or carried to the belt, the assisted ventilation system preserves autonomy and guarantees freedom of movement. There is a wide choice of solutions that meet most risks (protection of the eyes, face, head, ears ...) and for most activities. * Do not use these systems when the oxygen concentration is> 19.5%.

In 7 points 3 the materials used in the manufacture of gloves have very different properties and comforts. They are often associated for optimal protection. 4 However, there is no glove that meets all risks and keeps sufficient dexterity to achieve all manual tasks: the necessary protections must be targeted. The EN ISO 21420 standard, I identifying gloves of protection The risks I potentially measuring the levels The EN ISO 21420: 2020 establishes the choosing of protection General requirements of the protective gloves. It must be used in need the comfort association with one or more others from my glove standards of EPI gloves that refer to it. Page 164 Page 165 Page 169 EN ISO 21420: 2020 Pose a fundamental principle: safety.EPI gloves should not affect I identify potential health risks or provoke harmful effect to the user. It also determines the system of sizes and fundamental requirements in terms of dexterity and comfort. New requirements appeared in 388 EN 511 in 407 EN 659 EN 12477 with its renewal in March 2020, Cold impact specific specific heat Firefighters welders, especially for multilayer gloves, mechanical aggressions whose lining should not be detached. Page 166 Page 167 Page Other layers when removing the hand. The legislator has created a normative system by risk or by profession. Each standard provides tests that prove the protection provided by the glove, and assigning performance levels. In 1082 in 374 it would be tempting to choose a glove of which breaks aggression chemical knives The maximum level of protection is by impact obtained on each test, but the interest page 168 to stick to the strict need for protection is. 'Ensure a more comfortable glove to wear daily. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the precise risks for which you need a good protection.

The RG group offers you a choice 7 the EN 388 + A1: 2018 standard that defines the mechanical risks that allows you to find almost always present, it has experienced a great renewal a glove partner of your work in 2018. On a daily basis: which protects you in the best conditions of comfort. I measure the necessary levels of protection the mechanical risks: the EN 388 + A1: 2018 the protective gloves in accordance with EN 388 + A1: 2018 provide protection against, at least, one of the following mechanical risks: abrasion , cut (which now enjoys two tests), tear, perforation, impact. Why two tests at the cut? The first cut-off test defined in EN 388 + A1: 2018, is the test at the cutting cut. This test is insufficient for gloves I identify strongly resistant to the cut. The new materials used in the manufacture of gloves quickly use the circular blade with which the test is carried out. The second cut-off test is defined by EN ISO 13997: 1999.This test is closer to the actual working conditions. It borrows the image of a hand that exerts variable pressure on a cutting object. When a good or a very good level of protection at the cut is necessary, the result of this test must be taken into account. Why a new impact on impact? This new test confirms by the evidence the attenuation of shocks on a part of the hand. According to the glove, it can be the palm, back or joints. The protected area is specified in the package leaflet. This performance of the glove reduces one of the factors of musculoskeletal disorders as defined by social security, the consequence of mechanical shocks and vibrations. In 388 how to determine my level of protection? The mechanical risks are very different from each other. A first approach is to identify your risks and assess the necessary level of protection. 4543FP Risks Abrasion Cutting by tearing Perforation cut according to ISO 13997 Impact slicing (optional test) (optional test) Meaning Risk: Measure: lesion made on the resistance of the injury risk: measure: shocks repeatedly loss of the layers The number of hand by a Object Glove to tear by a lesion tip made on the necessary force suffered by the hand. from the cutting cycle epidermis cutting.During the burr or burrs hand by (in Newton) hand by abrasive paper handling.

Cold risk and impermeability: the EN 511: 2006 gloves in accordance with EN 511: 2006 provide protection against the risks of cold up to -50 ¬∞ C. There are two types of risks: the cold of convection and cold conduction. A water resistance test is also performed. Level 1 means that the protection against the cold remains effective when the glove is skept. The level 0 must be marked to signal the loss of quality of the glove.EN 511 How to determine my level of protection? The determination of the level of protection must also take into account the environment (ambient temperature, humidity, wind), but also clothing worn, the duration of the exposure, the need for dexterity ...

In 6 points 3 the comfort of a workwear depends on its confection and tissues used. Workwear or protective clothing? The workwear is a garment designed to protect themselves from dirt. Long remained basic, it is today a technical garment, resistant, adapted by business and by environment. It sometimes incorporates normed parts like knee pads and participates in the protection of the wearer. The protective clothing is a PPE to be worn to protect from one or more risks that may threaten the health and safety of the wearer (Labor Code, Article R.233 - 83 - 3). It responds to one or more standards, systematically associated with the basic standard in ISO 13688: 2013. Workwear, protective clothing: work clothes, protective clothing that buys, which maintains? or image clothes? According to Directive 89/656 / EEC, companies increasingly equip their individual employees must be provided free of charge by the \"customized\" clothing employer who aim to protect risks, which ensures their proper functioning and Their hygienic state to enhance the brand image of the company and to create satisfactory by interviews, repairs and replacements a sense of belonging. required\". The employer must provide and maintain protective clothing. This obligation was extended to work clothing by the Labor Code in 2008 (Article R4323 - 95). The REACH Regulation All clothing is subject to REACH regulation. Its strict application is important for products in direct contact with the skin. REACH guarantees a limited and framed presence of chemicals in the composition of clothing. Oekotex Standard Label 100, a body created by 20 control institutes, is a visible evidence of respect for REACH regulation. The labeling is verifiable on the OEKOTEX website (https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/).The EN ISO 13688: 2013, Basic Protective Clothing Standard The ISO 13688: 2013 standard establishes the basic requirements of protective clothing. It must be used in association with one or more other standards that refer to it. It defines the basic properties of the protective clothing. It poses a fundamental principle: safety. Protective clothing should not affect health or hygiene of the wearer. It also determines the system of size, marking and essential requirements in terms of design and comfort. Because protective clothing is washable and reusable PPE, ISO 13688: 2013 provides for aging obligations and the persistence of clothing properties after several wash cycles. Finally, it poses environmental protection requirements: optimizing sustainability, facilitating recycling, minimizing packaging waste.

Ergonomic tests at the wear attest to the good positioning of the pocket in front of the leg to protect the knee. In 14404 there are 2 kinds of kneeling: there are 3 knee-knee performance classes: Type 1: Designates Class 1 knee pads: Use on external flat soils that fit with strips. Class 2: Use on Granular Floors Type 2: Designates Class 3 Knee Knee: Usage On Rugged Soils That Start In The Knee Knee Pockets Type X In 13688. Class Y The Risk of Chain Saw Lesion: Standard EN 11393: 2019 EN 11393: 2019 Specifies the requirements of trousers, jackets and protection gloves against chain saw lesions. These protectors offer an anti-eye protection system specifically adapted to these portable tools.

High-visibility clothing is intended to visually report the presence of the wearer in all lights of brightness, day thanks to the high visibility fluorescent material, by night thanks to the retro-reflective bands in the light of the headlights the upper-visibility clothing: EN ISO 20471: 2017 The requirements of the standard are: the fluorescent color, the retro-reflective bands, the minimum surfaces of these two components and the positioning of the materials used. Fluorescent, yellow, orange or red tissues meet UV standards and washing resistance. The tissues are mechanically tested. The retro-reflective bands consist of glass beads or prisms. They must have a very good mechanical strength to withstand a minimum number of washes.Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Proportion Surfaces Proportion Surfaces Surfaces of minimals of minimum minimum materials Materials The standard establishes 3 classes Reflective material 0.10 m2 0.13 m2 0.20 m2 of visibility as a matter of function 014 M2 Surfaces of high-visibility fluorescent material and reflective retro- 0.50 m2.

There are many equipment to protect the man at work, whose levels of protection are defined by standards based on the type of risk and gravity. These clothes meet requirements in terms of abrasion resistance, cutting or sting, so that the wearer is not accidentally and suddenly exposed to chemical risk. Choosing the type of protection plus a garment is sealed, the less it lets the vapor pass, the less comfortable it is to wear. It is essential to stick to the strict need for protection and make the choice of comfortable protective equipment to be worn daily.Type 1 EN 943-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN 943-2: Requirements for Emergency Services Set Combination of Gas Waterproof Chemical Protection and Breathable Air Powered by Multirisk Type 2 Respiratory Protection in 943-1: General Requirements Risk Combination Chemical protection maintained by overpressible air supply non-sealed with plus types 3 in 14605: 2009: general requirements in addition combination of chemical protection Waterproof to liquids high clothes Type 4 EN 14605: 2009: General requirements Combination of chemical watertight chemical or liquids sprayed type 5 EN 13982 + AI 2011: General requirements Disposable combination Chemical protective combination in the form of solid or reusable particles Type 6 EN 13034: 2009: General requirements Consult the instructions Combination of chemical protection For accidental exposure to spraying or Splash Type PB EN 13034: 2009: General requirements Partial protection of the body for accidental exposure to spraying or splashing Consider the chemical to which the carrier is exposed the resistance of a material to a chemical is not permanent.

This protection is often associated with heat and flame protection in multi-listed clothing. To be well protected, the carrier of antistatic clothing must also be connected to the ground through conductive safety shoes.Electricians who work on, on the other hand, must be isolated from the Earth with insulating safety shoes. Www.groupe-rg.com 228 General catalog Multirisquest clothing: a solution for harsh environments Multi-lisk clothes are clothing that meets a risk association currently present in the chemical and petrochemical industry, extracting at synthesis Hydrocarbons. These are environments in which the presence of the human is at the same time source of risk for himself as for the environment. Multirisk garment is therefore a garment that combines chemical risk, fire / flame risk and electrostatic risk. It sometimes adds the cold risks, rain and also the risk of lack of visibility. I choose the comfort of my equipment The choice of fabric, the quality of clothing and the design of the garment are determining elements to guarantee the best comfort. Textiles for several years, manufacturers redouble innovation to offer ever more technical textiles. Optimal performance inserts are positioned, strategically, to bring more resistance and comfort to the garment. For example, Cordura¬Æ is found very often positioned at the kneepads, or a tissue that contains elastane at the waist.The properties of a fabric depend on 3 factors the fibers the weaving grammage 160g / m2 cotton fibers natural canvas strong and resistant weave. 180g / m2 plus polyamide fabric Twill Armor less resistant 210g / m2 in addition thick to abrasion as the canvas, and durable but more comfortable fiber wear. 250g / m2 Synthetic polyester John is a twill. Satin 300g / m2 Brilliant armor, more fragile than the canvas and the elastane twill, but which limits the 320g / m2 passage of dust. The properties of the main fibers advantages Benefits low resistance to mechanical risks, abrasion: natural fiber offering 100% cotton comfort and hygiene resists less time in time in one thanks to the absorption of perspiration. Aggressive environment. Synthetic fiber very resistant to abrasion and friction, does not absorb the perspiration and offers a touch of 100% infringeable polyester, with a good color holding and a dream interview: the lack of comfort. easy in time. This mixture offers the advantage of cotton comfort (60% cotton absorption, 40% polyester less resistant than the 35% cotton / 65% polyester. Sweating and pleasant touch) and polyester resistance. This mixture offers the advantage of cotton comfort (pleasant touch) 35% cotton, 65% less comfortable polyester than 60% cotton / 40% polyester. and resistance and good resistance in the polyester time.Polyamide synthetic fiber resistant to abrasion, does not resist heat, does not absorb perspiration. Also called durable nylon over time. Elastane additive synthetic fiber offering elasticity also called spandex and comfort to the initial fabric.

According to this norm, the S1, S2, S3 shoes must be antistatic. This property protects carriers against the risks associated with electrostatic accumulation, which, when discharging, can cause dangerous sparks in flammable or explosive areas. Certified shoes according to EN 61340-5-1: 2016, marked with ESD logo, provide increased safety against electrostatic discharges with more targeted requirements in this area, such as protecting electronic devices against electrostatic phenomena.The ESD shoes test area is smaller than the antistatic shoe area: an ESD shoe is necessarily antistatic.

These shoes are the best selling in France. They have a shock protection cap of 200 joules and an antiperforation insert. ‚Ä¢ If the work is done indoors in a dry place, you have to privilege S1P shoes that are more breathable. ‚Ä¢ S3 shoes are more clinging, and are suitable for exterior work on rugged terrain.A SRA shoe, SRB or SRC? Technological advances allow most safety shoes to comply with both sliding standards, and thus claiming an SRC performance. The SRA standard is closer to the conditions of use of the agri-food industry. A steel, aluminum or composite tip? Lightness remains a major criterion of choice and comfort. The composite tip is lightweight, non-conductive of heat or cold, free, but it may be wider. The steel and aluminum tips are fine. The aluminum tip is lightweight. The aluminum and composite tips bring a better balance of the masses of the shoe and thus from walking. How to find waterproof shoes? S2 and S3 shoes have rods resistant to water and oil penetration. This property, marked WRU, does not concern the entire shoe. It takes a shoe marked Wr so that it is totally waterproof. This seal has a temporal limit and does not resist immersion in water. Only rubber boots or polymeric material can. 303 Innovation at the service of comfort and protection Ergos security shoes stand out.

The adaptation of the equipment point to the anchor work situation Connection 2 The position of the operator with respect to the anchor 1 There are two major risks to consider when you want to set up an individual fall protection protection effective.They are both linked to the position of the operator relative to the anchor point of his fall arrest system. ‚Ä¢ Pendulum risk: The anchor point is not exactly located above the operator's release 3 which is offset from the latter. It risks a vertical pendulum effect during its fall, and therefore potentially hit a dangerous element. ‚Ä¢ The risk of poorly measuring the draft: which is the necessary distance to stop air and absorb a fall of a person without encountering the soil or any hazardous obstacle. 4 Available Air Tile Measure: + (F AaclLtoEnugr Edme ECNHTU DTEE XL 'ALOBNSGOURBEEUN RD + U DCIOSNTNAENCCTEE DUER) S + E-CTAAUIRLILTEE.

      "Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament who had been interrupted on Friday, December 17th and I renew you all my Vux hoping that you had a good holiday. As you have seen, the big \"year 2000 bug\" did not happen. On the other hand, citizens of a number of our countries have been victims of natural disasters that have really been terrible. You wanted a debate on this subject in the coming days during this session. In the meantime, I would like, as a number of colleagues asked me, that we observed a minute of silence for all the victims, storms, in particular, in the different countries of the European Union who were affected. I invite you to get up for this minute of silence. (Parliament, standing, observes a minute of silence) Madam Chair, it's a procedural motion. You have probably learned by the press and television that several bomb and crimes attacks have been perpetrated in Sri Lanka. One of the people who has just been murdered in Sri Lanka is Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament just a few months ago. Do not you think, Madam Chair, that a letter should be written to the President of Sri Lanka to communicate that Parliament deplores violent deaths, including that of M.Ponnambalam, and to urge him to do all that is in his power to seek peaceful reconciliation and put an end to this particular situation. Yes, Mr. Evans, I think an initiative in the sense that you have just suggested would be completely appropriate. If the Assembly agrees, I will do as Mr. Evans suggested. Madam President, it's a procedural motion. I would like to ask you for advice on Article 143, which concerns inadmissibility. My question is about a topic that is on the agenda of Thursday and that I will raise a new time. Paragraph 6 of the Cunha Report on Multiannual Guidance Programs, which will be submitted to Parliament on Thursday, proposes to introduce sanctions applicable to countries that do not meet the annual reduction targets for their fleet. It specifies that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability. In my opinion, the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the Common Fisheries Policy and any proposal the upsetting would be legally inadmissible. I would like to know if one can move forward an objection to what is only a report, not a legislative proposal, and if I am entitled to do so on Thursday. It is exactly at that time that you can, in fact, if you wish, raise this question, that is to say, before the beginning of the presentation of the report.Madam President, whereas the first session of the European Parliament takes place, the execution of a sentenced to death in Texas in the United States, a 34-year-old young man called Hicks, was fixed, unfortunately, next Thursday. At the request of a French member, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been introduced; She has harvested many signatures including mine. However, I ask you, in accordance with the orientation now constantly expressed by the European Parliament and the entire European Community, to intervene with the President and Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush, by making the prestige of your mandate and the 'Institution that you represent, because it's Mr. Bush who has the power to suspend the death sentence and pardon the convict. And all this in respect of the principles we have always supported. Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do it well. It is indeed quite in line of positions that our Parliament has always adopted. Madam Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to a case that parliament regularly. This is the case of Alexander Nikitin. We all welcome, in this connection, that the court delivered its liberation and clearly established that in Russia too, access to environmental information was a constitutional right.However, it is necessary that it seems to be prosecuted again, the public prosecutor who appealed. We know, and we have established it in many resolutions - including in the last session of last year - that this case is not only a legal nature and that it is False to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal activity and betrayal because we are affected by his results and we take advantage of it. These results form the basis of the European Sea Protection programs and that is why I ask you to consider a draft letter depicting you the essential facts of this case and to communicate to Russia the position that derives from the decisions. Parliament. Yes, Ms. Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts about this issue when I have received your letter. Madam President, I would first like to congratulate you for holding Word because indeed, in this first session, in this new year, the number of television channels has really been significantly increased in our premises. However, Madam Chair, what I asked for was not realized. There are two Finnish chains and a Portuguese chain, but there is still no Dutch chain.Yet I had asked you for a Dutch chain, because the Dutch too wanted to be able to follow the news each month when sent to this land of exile. I therefore ask you again to do the necessary so that we can have a Dutch chain. Ms. Plooij-Van Gorsel, I can tell you that this question is on the agenda of the Wednesday Questor Meeting. She will be, I hope, examined in a positive spirit. Madam President, how is it that Parliament does not comply with the regulation of health and safety it votes? How is it that no air quality test has been done in this building since our election? How is the health and hygiene committee since 1998 since 1998? How is it that we have never done an evacuation exercise in the buildings of the Parliament of Brussels and Strasbourg? How is it that there are no instructions in case of fire? How is it that stairs have not been improved since my accident? How is it that we do not respect non-smoking areas? We are voting regulations and we do not even comply with it. It's scandalous. Ms. Lynne, you are absolutely right and I will check if all this has not been done.I will also submit the problem at the College des Questeurs and I am sure our quaestors will have to ensure that we respect the regulation that we are voting. Madam President, Mrs. D√≠ez Gonz√°lez and myself had presented some questions on certain opinions expressed by the Vice-President, Ms. de Palacio, and published in a Spanish newspaper. The competent services did not include them on the agenda, advancing that responses had already been made during a previous session. I ask that this decision be reconsidered because it is not the case. The questions that were previously answered related to Madame de Palacio's intervention in a specific record, not to the statements published in the ABC newspaper of November 18th. Dear colleague We will check all that. I will admit that, for the moment, things seem to me a little confused. So, we will see that very seriously for everything to be in order. Madam Speaker, I would like to know if this week, Parliament will send a clear message expressing its dissatisfaction with the decision today to refuse to renew the arms embargo to Indonesia, while by the Past, Parliament has subscribed to a very large majority in the arms embargo for Indonesia.Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous, given the situation on site. Parliament should therefore send a message to this effect, since a vast majority of members wishes. By refusing to prolong the embargo, the Member States show irresponsibility. Some have said it, the situation in Indonesia is extremely explosive. There is actually a risk of coup. We do not know what's going on. Why should EU weapons producers get rich on the back of innocent people? In any case, this question does not appear for the moment among emergency applications for next Thursday. Order of the Work The Agenda calls for the consideration of the final agenda project as established by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, January 13, in accordance with Rule 110 of the Regulations. S 'acting on Monday and Tuesday, I do not have any changes. With regard to Wednesday: the socialist group asks to include a statement from the Commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years, as well as on the Commission's administrative reform. I would like Mr. Bar√≥n Crespo, author of the request, intervenes to justify it, he wishes him of course. Then we will do as usual: we will hear a speaker for and a speaker against.Madam Speaker, the presentation of the Prodi Commission's Political Program for the entire legislature was initially a proposal from the Group of the European Socialist Party, which was unanimous at the Conference of Presidents in September, but also. Explicit approval by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment to his investiture speech. This commitment is important to the extent that the Commission is an organization that holds, in accordance with the treaties, the monopoly of the initiative and which, therefore, decides who would be the political and legislative activity of this Parliament during the course. of the next five years. I also remind you of Madam President that this Parliament voted twice confidence in President Prodi at the previous legislature; During this legislature, he voted again in July and, then, with the entry into office of the new commission, he gave his confidence in September to the entire commission. He has passed enough time so that the Commission prepares its program and so that we can read it and explain it to citizens. In this sense, I remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.The events that occurred last week born on the sidelines of the Conference of Presidents and use it for the sole purpose of corroborating and ratifying decisions taken outside of it create a dilemma: or the Commission is unable to present this program; (In this case, it would be appropriate for it to be clear. According to its President, the Commission would be able to do so. Since the Commission is represented by the Vice-President, Ms. de Palacio, I believe What before voting, it would be good to know the Commission's position with respect to its availability to present the program, as agreed) or Parliament is unable to consider this program, as some seem to pretend. In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean the rejection of our responsibilities as Parliament, in addition to the introduction of an original thesis, an unknown method of communicating to the political groups the speech of the Commission's program in writing week before and not the day before, as it had been agreed, taking into account the fact that the legislative program would be discussed in February, so that we could move from the debate, because the next day, the press and the Internet would have brought to the attention of all citizens and Parliament would no longer have a reason to take care of it.My group believing that a parliament is there to listen, to discuss and think, we believe that no reason justifies this adjournment and we believe that if the Commission is able to present it, we have perfect time to restore the The original agreement between the Parliament and the Commission and to act in a responsible manner vis-√†-vis our fellow citizens and concitizers. As a result, the proposal of the Group of the European Socialist Party that you mentioned is to maintain the presentation of the Prodi Commission's legislature program, including in the program the draft administrative reform because, if not. Not done, we may find ourselves in a paradoxical position: under the pretext that there is no text, it is refused on the one hand the right of the President of the Commission to speak in this Parliament and, of The other part, the holding of a debate on a reform which the Parliament does not know the texts. I therefore pray you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to express themselves now and that we then proceed to the vote. (Applause of the PSE group) Madam Chair, first and foremost, I would like it to be clear that the Commission has the greatest respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, in particular, for the one concerning the fixation of the order of the day. Therefore, we respect the decisions that Parliament could take in this direction.But I would also like it to be very clear that President Prodi is committed to Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr. Bar√≥n recalled, who is in addition to the annual debate on the legislative program of the legislative program. Commission, on the main lines of action for the next five-year period, that is to say for this legislature. I would like to say, Madam Chair, that, in which the September agree, this debate differs from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program. I would add, Madam Chair, that, on the side of the commission, we are ready and willing to organize this debate when it suits you, that we were ready to develop it this week, as it had been decided initially, Based on the fact that he was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups. I would like to repeat, Madam Chair, that, for our part, we have discussed the program of action for the next five years and that we are ready to come to present the program for the next five years when Parliament decides including This week, if that is its decision and the program for the year 2000, next month, what we have agreed perfectly. I propose that we votes on the request of the Socialist Group aimed at reinstating the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives.(Parliament rejects the request) The Chair. Always about Wednesday, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax. The PPEDE group asks to remove this item from the agenda. Is there a colleague to speak on behalf of the group and justify this request? Madam President, to respond to the laughter I have heard among the socialists, I was told that wide parts of the Socialist group would also like to remove this agenda item because during the vote within the Conference of Presidents. , colleagues responsible for the Socialist Group did not have the vote of the Working Group. I do not know if this information is correct, but in any case, the EPP-E-group would be grateful if you delete this agenda item because Parliament has repeatedly seized this issue. Decisions exist which oppose such a tax. That's why my group asks that this item be removed from the agenda. Thank you Mr. Poettering. We now hear Wurtz, which expresses against this demand. Madam Speaker, I would like to first emphasize Mr. Poettering's lack of logic. At the moment, he just took the lesson to the Socialist Group because it returns to a decision that was taken extremely clearly in the Conference of Presidents. But he does the same thing.We discussed, we were unanimous except the EPP group and the Liberal group and I even noticed, you will remember my dear colleagues, that the question is not whether you are for or against the Tobin tax But whether you dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think about it. It's not asking a lot. So I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council to know once and for all the position of these two bodies in relation to this relatively modest proposal, but which would give an important signal to opinion, in particular. After the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle Conference. We will vote on the request of the PPE-ED Group to withdraw the oral question concerning the capital tax on the agenda. (Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions) Madam Chair, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for the advertising blow that he has just given this debate. Thank you. Madam President, was my vote being recorded, which could not be done electronically because I do not have my card? I voted \"for\". Indeed, if we add the two colleagues who have manifested, we obtain as a result .... Madam Chair, the Presidency proclaimed the result of the vote. The changes have no place to be.Madam Chair, in the last vote and I rely on your decision - on the question of the Commission's strategic plan, I reported that I was asking for the floor before the vote on behalf of my group. But my request was not satisfied. I will be glad, at the end of this agenda item, allow me to provide a voting explanation on behalf of my group. It is important. It would be useful to record in the minutes of Parliament the way people perceive what we have just done, in the light of their own political analysis. Madam Speaker, I do not want to revive the debate but I also asked for the floor to express myself as to Mr. Bar√≥n Crespo's request. Me either, you did not give me the floor. I deplore it but the vote was done, the decision fell and so we should stay there. I'm sorry, Mr. H√§nsch and Mr. Cox, I did not see that you were asking for the floor. That being so, I believe that the positions are clear and they will be recorded in the minutes. When we adopt tomorrow the minutes of today's meeting, colleagues who will believe that positions have not been sufficiently explained to seek changes. It seems to me that it is a good formula. Of course, the minutes of the meeting of tomorrow will take into account all the complementary explanations.I think it's a better formula than to proceed now to voting explanations that would entail us very far. Mr. Cox, Mr. H√§nsch, does that suit you? Madam Speaker, if the minutes correctly reflects the vote of my group, I have and will not have any objection to formulate. If your decision is that I can not give explanation of voting, I accept it, but with some reservations. We will therefore pay close attention to the drafting of the minutes. We always do it always. If it does not reflect the positions well, we can possibly correct it. (Parliament adopts the Order of Work as amended) Security Advisers for the Transport of Dangerous Goods The Agenda calls for Mr. Koch's report (A5-0105 / 1999), on behalf of the Policy Committee Regional, transport and tourism, concerning the common position adopted by the Council for the adoption of the European Parliament and the Council Directive on the minimum requirements for the review of security advisers for road transport , by rail or navigable route of dangerous goods (C5-0208 / 1999 - 1998/0106 (COD)). Dear Commissioner, Dear President, Dear Colleagues, I congratulate myself without the slightest reserve of the Council adopted by the Council with a view to harmonizing the training of security advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or lanes. Navigable.First, on the formal basis, we had to act to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35 / EC who commits the Member States to put in place responsible for the transport of dangerous goods or security advisers and to organize the training and consideration of these persons, without expressing it explicitly. Secondly, by this directive, we aim to a) to increase the safety of both transport and transhipment of dangerous goods; (b) to dismantle the distortions of competition that result from the national differences in the structure and cost of training and (c) to generate equal opportunities between security advisers on the European labor market. . Third, with this directive, as it appears in the common position and, in particular, given that it limits itself exclusively to minimum standards, we guarantee a high degree of flexibility and a low regulation from The European Union and we contribute greatly to empower Member States. All this must be particularly hailed in terms of subsidiarity. I believe that our amendment proposals introduced at first reading have been taken into consideration satisfactorily.They have been taken over, transposed in the agreed mind or have been removed because the relevant European regulations have not been adopted, for example, a system of sanctions in the event of an offense or the complex development of questionnaires. . I am asking you to approve the proposed amendment adopted unanimously by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and on the timetable for implementation of the Directive. By imposing any specific date of implementation of the Directive by the Member States but by granting them a period of three months after the entry into force of the said directive, we introduce a flexibility clause that protects us from any delay in Implementation. I ask you for your approval. Madam President, we can not - we do not have the right - to resign ourselves to hear more and more often accidents that cause, on roads, rails and navigable, significant damage also attributable to fact that the persons concerned do not take the transport of dangerous goods quite seriously or by ignorance or lack of training of the driver or the person responsible for the various means of transport, it happens too often that an accident Benin turns to the disaster.As an Austrian - but I think it's the same for all of us - I still have a perennial memory of the catastrophe which, last year, cost many lives in the tunnel of Tauern and imposed Subsequently, for many months, the reconstruction work of the destruction caused by this fire, works whose financial impact was gigantic. This renovation, which has spread over several months, cut off this important path of communication between North and South Europe. The resulting diversion traffic has overwhelmed thousands of EU citizens to the boundaries of the bearable. In some municipalities in my country, it was really hell. Our response to such disasters must be prevention and the draft directive submitted to us allows us to create an important basis for well-trained security managers and at the same time to do what should be done. We should not really just have to evolve European law towards greater security. We must also ensure, therefore, that Member States respect the implementation times of our projects and, more importantly, we must ensure that subsequently these projects are applied. Please: That it is not an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore in which we will then have to deplore the implementation deficit.I would like to address one last point: we can not just fill one of the security network shortcomings and ignore that in terms of transportation safety, there is still a lot to do. In this respect, I invite and ask the responsible commissioner, presents among us, to present ourselves as soon as possible a text likely to increase in the future security in the tunnels so that in Europe, we should not do Faced with disasters of such magnitude. Madam Speaker, first and foremost, I would like to thank Mr. Koch from his report in the issue of transportation safety occupies a central place. It considers the harmonization of the level of requirements applicable to the review of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or waterway. I congratulate him on his excellent report. The safety of transport has unfortunately done the latest times: the railway accident from Paddington, in London, the frightful railway accident in Norway, the two aircraft accidents carrying passengers from the European Union and the natural disaster of Erika, off Brittany these events that have all been produced in the last four months remind us that we can only believe that the safety of transport is guaranteed automatically and that the officials of the Protection of the population are extremely motivated and qualified.The Rapporteur reported to Parliament that the Council's common position retains six of the ten amendments to the text presented by Parliament at first reading, as well as the content of the other amendments of Parliament. As a result, my group will support the common position and hopes that the legislation will be promulgated quickly, which will provide us with a more tool in our struggle so that transportation within the Union reaches the highest level of security possible. My group will make any initiative to improve transport safety. We still have much to do in this area, as shown by the news. Madam President, I would like to make some remarks. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise technical work on this issue and then the Commission for the proposal it made. This is the harmonization of the requirements of the exams, but also minimum requirements. In a sense, it's a shame. The importance of safety on the road, on the rails or on the waterways is naturally essential and because of the international character of these modes of transport, we must also harmonize the training courses for safety, as well as, in particular, The requirements of the new ADR that should soon come into effect. This is important but respect for these measures is equally and there are naturally several reasons why we have to pay special attention.Let's look at road accidents in recent years. For example in Belgium, the Netherlands and in some other countries in fog weather, with trucks carrying dangerous products, while under these conditions, they should have stayed on the edge of the road. Or boatmen and their eastern European ships that start their boats side by side, which makes the dangerous situations all the more obvious. In addition, a survey conducted in Belgian, Finnish and Japanese ports revealed that 50 percent of containers with partially dangerous loading were not properly discharged. In short, the subject is very important. If we look at the situation of security advisors, since January 1, in some countries, companies must have such a counselor. Compliance with this principle poses important problems currently, especially for less important companies that can not afford it financially. They will either get rid of their cargo, or they will mix it with other cargoes, which causes a series of problems. For this reason, these activities are required to be developed in the form of annual reports, business analyzes and that they may be included in ISO 9002 certificates. The work is done, it is still a question of ensure respect. I allow myself to raise a last point.With regard to this respect, satisfactory agreements should also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because it is only on 1 July 2001, in just over a year and a half, that they will adhere to the conventions in force. This will give them a temporary competitive advantage. It does not matter in itself, but what we should do is give priority to the aspects of the security of the goods transported by road, by rail or by waterway and present as soon as possible this part of the acquis as soon as possible. candidate countries. Madam Speaker, in this Parliament, the right attention is regularly drawn on the importance of safety in transport. The increasing quantities of goods crossing Europe generate, knowingly or not, a whole series of risks for staff who are responsible for it and society in general. As a result, those that are subject to these risks must meet strict requirements. The standards imposed on this effect in another Directive, 95/35 / EC seem sufficiently adequate to inform people responsible for organizing the transport of dangerous goods. I am pleased that there is also an agreement with the Council on the minimum standards for their exams, even if I would have preferred fixed and standard standards, in order to have identical international diplomas and examinations. However, it does not seem achievable.To conclude, the amendment proposed by the rapporteur is no longer logical and I support it with joy. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, I would first like to congratulate our colleague Koch for his reports, which to be technical, are no less of great importance for safety. I would like to make a few rare remarks. I would first like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my view will not remain a dead letter - we pay more attention to the question of security, whether on the road, on the way Navigable or at sea. When I consider that the Commission's first proposal was filed on 19 March 1998 and that we occupy it today - while Parliament reacted fairly quickly - the deadline is a little too long. The fault does not come back to the single commission but I think we have to react faster to achieve harmonization in this area too. The second point has already been mentioned: the minimum standards. Basically, I believe that in many areas affecting transportation, we should target greater flexibility and country by country regulations. As for security, however, I am somewhat skeptical because, on the principle, security is not different in Sweden, for example, of what it is in Germany, Italy or Austria.I can accommodate these minimum standards but I ask the Commission to follow this file with a real attention. If this kind of flexibility had to focus on unsatisfactory regulations in some countries, we should opt for greater harmonization. The third point has also been mentioned. As Mr. Rack, I come from a transit region in which this issue plays a special role. We do not want unilateral deterioration of competition conditions prevailing in some countries for countries such as Austria or other transit regions. I think, however, that we should do everything possible to limit the transport of dangerous goods as much as possible, in all countries, whether they are transit or not regions. Mr. Chairman, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, his wonderful work and his positive collaboration with the Commission to improve the texts, present this report and proposal; In the end, only an amendment has been presented, which relates to the requirements for the aptitude review of the safety consultants for road transport, by rail or in the navigable route of dangerous goods. We believe that collaboration, the common work on the part of the two institutions Parliament and Commission is important and that the cooperation that exists with the regional policy, and concretely with the transport group, is beautiful.The Common Position includes virtually all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the proposed date, much more realistic than that originally projected by the Commission, Knowing that it's been a number of years that we are debating this issue. Very briefly, I would also like to thank the various deputies of their interventions and say that security is a priority of the Commission in the field of transport. As Mr. Simpson said very well, we must never consider that the process is acquired, he has succeeded. The process to increase margins, security guarantees in transportation is a process that should be improved day after day. In this sense, I would also like to very briefly address the problems of tunnels, to which mm. Rack and Swoboda referred, and which, in the case of Austria, are undoubtedly a very sensitive subject, which is necessary for which it is necessary to make efforts to see how to increase their safety. During one of the big accidents recently occurred, the transported goods were not dangerous in itself. Margarine and a few pounds of painting that normally did not have risks, provoked a real disaster.Therefore, the way you can adjust the requirements to ensure maximum safety requirements. Finally, I would like to say that it is necessary to approach the security of all types of transport. This week, we will organize a debate here to talk about the safety of maritime transport, as a result of the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss through the security, security, air transport throughout this year. But I want to say, ladies and gentlemen, that security is a priority objective of the Commission. As I will say during the debate on Erika, we are not waiting for a disaster to spend body and soul on the aspect of security, but we work on the sidelines of these circumstances, which only make Highlight the urgency of an effective response to this type of problem. I want to reiterate my thanks to all stakeholders and more particularly to the rapporteur, Mr. Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 o'clock. Transport of dangerous goods by road The agenda calls on the report (A5-0104 / 1999) of M.Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/55 / ‚Äã‚ÄãEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of goods Dangerous by road (COM (1999) 158 - C5-0004 / 1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)). Mr President, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, the Directive Entry into force on 1 January 1997 and aimed at the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road contains some transitional provisions whose validity is limited in time and time. linked to the conclusion of the CEN work, the European Standardization Committee. The delays in CEN work currently leads to problems in the very application of the Directive. In particular, it is annexes that can not be adapted to respond to technical and industrial evolution. I deplore it because we must act because others have not done their job. To this extent, I therefore accept the proposed amendment to Directive 94/55 / ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is subject to our review. The inaction of the European Union would require Member States to modify their legal provisions in this area for a short period of time, namely until the conclusion of CEN work, resulting in unnecessary costs and uncertainties.The amendment on the agenda therefore does not lead to any modification of existing Community harmonization in the transport of dangerous goods. It only extends the transitional regulations by repelling the deadlines, removes provisions that have ceased to be relevant and regulates the procedures for what is (a) ad hoc transport of dangerous goods and (b) the promulgation of national provisions less strict, especially for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods in strictly delimited areas. In doing so, the amendment of the Directive is fully in the spirit of subsidiarity; Member States benefiting from increased skills. The European Commission decides whether Member States may enact specific specific provisions, the regulatory procedure providing it with this purpose of the support of a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods. In June 1999, a Council decision redefined the terms of the performance of the executing powers conferred on the Commission. However, this proposal for a directive amending the Dangerous Goods Transportation Directive dates back to May 1999 and therefore could not take into account the current comitological procedure.On two specific cases, the proposals of amendment introduced by the Commission and having been the subject of a unanimous agreement concern precisely on this modified comitological procedure. We would like to be sure that this is already reported in the recitals and that the clear delay in which the Council must make a decision be set at a maximum of three months. In addition, we insist on the need for increased transparency. Another proposal for amendment also allows the Member States within which work and transport are conducted regularly under temperatures significantly below -20¬∫C to enact more stringent requirements, particularly with regard to the tanks. the particular interest of the northern regions of Europe. Finally, a last proposal for amendment should continue to use the tanks and vehicles put into service between January 1, 1997 and the entry into force of this directive if their construction and maintenance meet the requirements. While knowing that this is only a small step towards greater transportation on transportation, please approve this report. Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I send you all my Vux for the new year and the new millennium.It is the first time I speak in plenary, so there is something to be a little nervous, a bit like with the first love, but the first love still lasted happily more than two minutes. I would like to briefly comment on the Commission proposal amending the Directive on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road. It is a good thing that this directive is arrested now, because otherwise the Member States would be obliged to modify their national legislation for a very short transitional period, which would only result in unnecessary costs and would increase again the discontent. people facing community bureaucracy. However, the proposal of the Commission does not consider all the necessary factors. I think for example at the cold climate of northern regions. So I proposed some amendments to the report, excellent in itself, Mr. Koch, amendments that were adopted by our commission. My amendments relate to the cold resistance of the transport tanks of hazardous substances. According to the Commission proposal, a limit of 20¬∫ would have been sufficient; It is difficult to imagine, when one is edge of the Mediterranean, as in Laponia the temperature drops sharply below this limit. In Lapland too, people are favorable to the European Union, so think about them. That's why I proposed that the limit be lowered to -40¬∫.This measure would be really needed to maintain transportation safety in northern regions. I hope that my proposal will be taken into consideration during the vote of tomorrow. Mr. Chairman, if you allow, I would first like to congratulate you on the diligence you have shown by taking over the flight the presidency during this debate. I found this quite exceptional. As for the theme itself, I think that the citizens of Europe must be able to count on the fact that the goods transported on the roads, the railways and other European transport routes, whether or not it is Dangerous goods, are transported as safe as possible. This directive contributes to it. In the merits, what we do is annoying. The rapporteur, Mr. Koch, whom we thank for the work he has accomplished, pointed out that, in the merits, all of this could already be a little more advanced without the negligence of the CEN, which was very slow to develop and Harmonize the directive. We can only hope - and we should make all the decisions for this purpose during this week - that in 2001, we have finally had community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road to advance in terms of Legal safety and also security on our roads.Mr. Chairman, the report to which we do not imply, in itself, great changes. Most of the proposals for amendment are purely technical. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that whenever we make a decision of this type, it is a good thing from the point of view of the environment, in this case because this provision will create better conditions for operation. from the internal market. Large quantities of dangerous goods are transported via the roads, the rail network and the ports of the European Union. It is therefore necessary to adopt adequate regulations to govern these transport. We gradually get, sector after sector, that Member States apply common minimum rules. It is a very positive evolution, and we have every reason to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, for the work he has done on this subject. It is also an important issue with regard to the operating conditions of the internal market. If we want to make sure that the Common Transport Market works at the Union level, it is important not only that rules exist, but that, as far as possible, these rules are common to us. Finally, I would like to comment on a third point that seems essential to me, namely a proposal for amendment which was filed by Mr. Ari VaTanen.The context of our various Member States is, in many ways, various. This proposal for amendment aims to take into account the great colds that the northern regions of the Union can be seen. It is a particular circumstance that requires the effect also the effect that these very low temperatures on goods and their packaging can also be taken into consideration. Mr. Chairman, the fact of printing some flexibility to this regulation is positive. I hope that the Commission will accept this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank not only Mr. Koch but also the Vice-President of the Commission for having held as clearly in favor of safety in the field of transport and recognizing the priority nature of the Commission. If Mr. Koch has written his good relationship, it's because the work has not been done too rapidly within the UN and the United Nations Economic Commission. I would like to ask the Deputy Chair if she can tell us where the harmonization efforts made by these two organizations and the EU has the opportunity to accelerate these efforts by applying principles as simple as possible. For one thing is clear: even if we adopt excellent regulations within the European Union, traffic does not stop at these borders; He crosses them.This is why larger regulations, namely broader regional level, are certainly judicious. If the commissioner can not do it today, would it be ready to communicate in writing to the Commission the current situation and the state of the negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission? Mr. Chairman, I reiterate my congratulations to Mr. Koch of the work he has accomplished for that other report, which comes in a certain way the debate we had in October on rail transportation. . We all regret that the European Standardization Committee (CEN) has not been able to achieve on time fixed the amendment of the necessary provisions to achieve appropriate harmonization within the European Union. This debate and the modification of the directive currently in force allow us to introduce differential facts that testify to the diversity of our Europe. A few moments ago, Mr. Vatanen talked about lower temperatures, no more than -20 degrees, but at -40 degrees. We obviously accept this amendment, which is quite justified, and I think that concrete circumstances must be introduced which testify to the climate variety of the European Union, which sometimes translates into specificities and in concrete requirements at the moment when It is a question of considering standardizations or characterizations of the technical type.In relation to what Mr. Swoboda said about the CEN activity, I would like to say that we insist on them so that they would accelerate their work as it would be dramatic that, despite the new deadline, We found ourselves in a little over a year before the same difficulties for having been unable to provide a solution. Finally, Mr. Chairman, we have already highlighted the fundamental problems that justify this amendment to the Directive, we have mentioned the delay of the CEN, the modification of a few provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the directive. annexes, the need to make greater precision. All the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, who resulted in various amendments, concretely four, are taken over by the Commission. We accept the four amendments that have been proposed to us. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 o'clock. Coordination Structural Funds / Cohesion Fund The Agenda calls on the report (A5-0108 / 1999) of Ms. Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Communication of the Commission \" Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund. Guidelines for the programs of the period 2000-2006 \"(COM (1999) 344 - C5-0122 / 1999 - 1999/2127 (COS)).Mr. Chairman, I am particularly pleased that my first intervention to the European Parliament concerns what the United Kingdom region I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales, considers the most important subject. . You are not without knowing that most of Wales has become eligible for Objective 1 of the Structural Funds Program. It is clear that many people in Wales see the Structural Funds program as a way to stop some of the great difficulties we are undoubted. We found that poverty is growing in Wales, which has been strengthened since 1997. We have seen the gap between the rich and the poor widen. We therefore expect the Structural Funds Program that it is not limited to considering an industrial restructuring, we want it also brings broader improvements to the entire economic base in Wales. What makes us a great harm is to believe that, in a way, the granting of the Structural Funds has been a victory of the government, while it only recognizes that the Walesland is well confronted with very great difficulties. That is why I would like to highlight some points that the Commission should, in my case, place in the foreground. We hope that the Commission will deal with points related to ad reference.We deplore that, in a way, the British figures masked Welsh figures. We also hope that the Commission will provide appropriate funding projects. We hope it will guarantee, by going against the British Government, the participation of the private sector in the planning phase, as sure it is safe to provide the main momentum for the expenditure of the Structural Funds. Finally, we ask the commissions to ensure that the Structural Funds are spent seamlessly. In this Parliament, transparency is too often lacking. In this area, the Commission can become the Great Friend of Wales. Mr. Chairman, our commission deals with these issues under many different angles, and to begin with I will talk about the angle of research. We consider very positive that, in its conclusions, the rapporteur took into account our proposal that the infrastructures of research should be expanded in the countries of cohesion by implanting vocational schools and universities so that they serve better. The populations in the least developed regions and that they allow people to remain in their region of origin. It is something that it is possible to achieve by taking measures at the level of the public authorities. Such decentralization of higher education is undoubtedly a useful policy when it comes to guaranteeing development.The second point on which we wanted to draw attention, precisely in the optics of industrial policy, it is that we would have liked to reflect on the coordination of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, the Commission attaches a plus Great attention to the impact of the progress of services, e-commerce and the use of the Internet. In the past, poverty and wealth were more dependent on the structures of economic life. The rich regions were those where there were industrial jobs, while today these regions may well have become a burden and be poor. It therefore becomes necessary to carry out investments in the new business sectors, the so-called \"electronic\" production and the production of electronic services, because they are sectors of the future. In my opinion, the report responsible for the preparation of the report has not sufficiently taken into consideration this aspect in its own report, and is why, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Foreign Trade, of the Research and energy, I attract the attention of the European Commission on this.Finally, since our commission is responsible for energy issues, we would have liked that there is even more emphasis on the support for renewable energies through the resources of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, which would have allowed by a process. of coordination, to increase the exploitation of renewable forms of energy, so that the insufficiency of the energy financing resources could have been offset thanks to these more substantial funds. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Ms. Schroedter for the work she has done in this area and explain to members that I intervene on behalf of my colleague, Ms. Flutere, who followed this topic for the Employment Commission. and social affairs but who is sick alas. I would like to draw attention to amendments 1 and 2 that the Employment and Social Affairs Committee has approved, but that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has not accepted. These amendments relate to the social economy and the need to put in place a social Risk Capital and financially support local development plans for employment potential and reinforcement of social cohesion. In the past, Parliament considered the social economy as a significant potential provider of jobs. These amendments are in line with Parliament that social exclusion is a serious problem that calls for a constructive action.We hope that those who are considering voting against these amendments will be able to give good reasons for their choice in Parliament and citizens who are looking for a job. In his report, Ms. Flutere also emphasizes an area where there is a cruel lack of coordination, while we desperately needed. The Commission's proposals refer to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of share of the European Social Fund. But the lack of guidelines is particularly regrettable, while the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlinking the interventions of the Social Fund to the Employment Strategy will be applied for the first time during the 2000-2006 program. One could say that the oblivion gives the impression that the Commission does not know how to ensure maximum coordination between the interventions of the European Social Fund, subject to a revision after 3 years and a half, and the national plans for the annual employment of the Member States. We hope that the Commission can reassure us and tell us that it is an oversight that it will repair constructively. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, the proposal made by the Commission, thus fulfilling its mandate, in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, a reasonable starting point.But I would like to point out here that this starting point shows us the challenges that we find ourselves: to maintain the population in rural areas, facing changes in all types of economic activities due to the growing loss of weight. agricultural sector in the face of the different sources of income of the rural society. This, added to the deficiencies of infrastructure and service networks and a generally very limited job offer and at most seasonal and not diversified, accentuate the rural exodus. The consequences are not expected. It is the young people who disappear, who acquire training and find a job outside rural areas, which has an adverse impact on these areas. This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the implementation of businesses and job creation. It must be taken into account that the rural area represents almost four-fifths of the territory of the European Union. Agriculture provides only 5.5% of the EU employment. In addition, three-quarters of our farmers are part-time and need effective extra revenue.This is why one of the most important and transcendent objectives that we should set in the European Union would be to focus our efforts on the creation of new workstations in rural areas, outside the agricultural sector, in Sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage restoration, implantation, business reconversion, new technologies, services, etc. However, if it is true that the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it remains essential not only if we want to avoid the economic and social disintegration of rural areas and the creation of new ghost towns, but also because That farmers play a fundamental role in the management of the territory, in the preservation of biodiversity and the protection of the environment. As a result, we support the implementation of a coherent agricultural and rural development policy with the objectives we have set and the fact that rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, must be competitive and multifunctional, both in The agricultural area only in opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.It is important to define general criteria for the spatial planning and balance of the population and to take into consideration the conclusions to which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has reached on five fundamental aspects, which have been only partially resumed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in points 16 and 17. In conclusion, I would like to ask the Commission that these five points be taken into consideration at the time of establishing its conclusions of the four Pillars, because I think, for the European Union, the retention of the population in the rural environment must be one of the priority objectives. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, I would like to start my intervention by thanking Ms. Schroedter, rapporteur, the work she has done. I think it's a very good job. In addition, I would like to thank her for her desire to dialogue with other political groups to find compromise formulas in this avalanche of amendments, perhaps more numerous than what we expected, but who really do Echo the importance of the report we are talking about. It is important to our eyes that the conclusions approved in this Parliament be taken into consideration by the Commission, at least in spirit, because at the level where we are, one might feel that we are not here an exercise. useless, purely rhetoric.But the truth is that we estimate, and this is reflected in the formulation of the conclusions, that the Commission must take into account what is approved in Parliament, mainly with regard to the revision of these orientations in the middle of the period. In our amendments, we emphasized the importance we agree to the creation of synergies needed between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community Initiatives, so that their application is best reflected, in the most profitable manner. , in the gradual elimination of inequalities between the regions and in the creation of workstations, which, ultimately, corresponds to the two fundamental objectives of the funds of which we are talking about. And to arrive at a faster and effective momentum in the satisfaction of these objectives, we believe that it is necessary to participate in this initiative the creators of employment, the true entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee the new sources of employment, namely the bosses. Especially the bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises take part in the distribution of these funds. If this is not the case, if the bosses feel excluded, if they can not participate, and I'm not talking about the management, but also the receipt of the funds, we will have missed a chance to reach our Objectives faster.To achieve these, to overcome inequalities between regions and looking for sources of employment, it is also important to focus on new technologies, transportation and communications networks and renewable energies. All this I insist with the participation of the private enterprise which, by joining its efforts to those of the general governments, supplementing them, without there any obstruction or exclusion, is that which will create social wealth and posts. work. Mr President, he's coming to remind my colleague, Mr. Evans, the cause of the eligibility of Wales to the Objective 1. It is the result of the discredited policies of his party, the Conservative Party. Let me also recall that when his party leader, Mr. Hague, was minister for the Wales, he respected no rule of the principle of additionality, which had earned him a severe letter from Commissioner Wulf -Mathies concerning regulatory obligations. I can assure you that the British Government has its regulatory obligations as to the Additionality of Objective 1. I suggest to Mr. Evans to re-read the Regulations. My group has proposed important amendments to the two reports we are looking at today. I would like to draw our attention to the essential role of the guidelines.The aim is to provide a framework and tool to support and stimulate economic regeneration, to obtain the best use of resources and this, within the broadest possible partnership, and to re-engage these areas on the road to Recovery and sustainable development so that they can eventually disconnect the regional artificial respirator. It is important to identify the capabilities and potential of our regions in the high technology sector. Indeed, the reports of the media particularly show that Europe quickly loses ground vis-√†-vis the United States in the highly growing high-tech industries. The realization of previous programs is also very informative. It allows us to determine how the guidelines should not consist. They should avoid creating additional layers of bureaucracy and paperwork. They should avoid the mid-term change in project development priorities and policies, as it inevitably leads to delays and only partial spending of available appropriations, particularly in light of new budgetary requirements. The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of an official or the other of the Commission or the public service.There must be internal coherence in the Commission's management, with respect for local specificities and regional aspects of the Commission's programs. To conclude, I will say that we must ensure that the guidelines are broad, indicative and flexible, to help our program managers and credits users and to promote the potential for our new areas of regeneration. If we manage to introduce entrepreneurship in our poor and structurally weak regions, they will regain the trust of important investors, key to successful success. We will consider that these guidelines are a success if the EU regional policy, through a good, strong and stimulating guidelines, manages to open up new perspectives and enable poor and structurally low regions to participate fully in the growth and prosperity of the EU. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, I would like to thank Ms. Schroedter for his excellent report; It is dedicated to its task and, during the review in committee, took into account the many amendments that have been made. The rapporteur also raises very precisely that Parliament has not been consulted in a timely manner about the guidelines. We are now very late.Let's hope that the European Parliament's positions will still be useful in the mid-term evaluation of programs and in practical implementation. Compared with when it happens to us, this report has become much too vast during successive exams. It has been integrated with retail issues and issues that have already been addressed in previous reports. At the stage where we are, it is better to focus on a reflection on how to guide the community regional policy, keeping in mind that the objective is the reduction of regional disparities. Our group emphasizes the principle of subsidiarity, on the responsibility of the Member States and the role of local actors in the development and implementation of programs. It is particularly important to involve SMEs in this development and implementation. Our group also believes that it is important to pay greater attention to the overseas regions and other peripheral regions and wants to increase the interaction between the city and the campaign. We oppose the interventionism of the central administration of the Union and that of the Member States and we are asking for a reduction in the bureaucracy which is embedded in the development and implementation of the programs.The effectiveness of the programs implemented with the support of the European Union has often had to suffer too slow decision-making and too complex management. Often resources have been attributed to projects that have left no sustainable benefit to the region concerned. Projects should be more efficient, more flexible and produce more results. The development of the report was an opportunity to conduct an interesting debate on Community regional policy in general. It was for us, new deputies, the first time, and it is an extremely interesting process. This report is quite good and our group supports it. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, the evidence that this Parliament has still not exceeded the phase of the consultative and subordinate institution is that the excellent report of my colleague, Ms. Elisabeth Schroedter, was not able to To arrive in plenary because the regional development plans for the 2000-2006 period for the Territories of Objective 1 have been on the table of the Commission for months. In view of the foregoing, we must require in any case, from this Assembly, that the Community support frameworks for the period in question are studied and subject to the debate in this Parliament, before their adoption and in the light of the orientations we present today.We consider that they contain a special ability to create jobs in the poorest or least developed territories. In this way, we would contribute to changing the negative trends in existing inequalities within the European society and to advance a fairer Europe. Mr. Chairman, we should not lose sight of the view that the main and strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and their coordination, is to achieve economic and social cohesion. It is our duty to participate in the development of guidelines, but also the evaluation of the results. And this because we are the representatives of the citizens of the citizens, and not only from a Europe of states and regions. We find that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion. If we take as the only indicator the gross domestic product per capita, we risk deceiving us. Some colleagues have already talked about unemployment and the decrease in demography. Some indicators will need to study us to study the state and evolution of regional societies that are in a lower situation than others.In some reports presented today before Parliament, it is clear that the most prosperous European regions have five times less unemployed than the 25 least prosperous regions. This obliges the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission to act decided and strategically. I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity where it was not given, because it was the end of the legislature to speak about the guidelines. But I do not think the report arrives late. We need a joint reflection for the new programs of Objective 1 and the regional development plans that have been developed even before the guidance becomes operational can be revised and a real. Evaluation. It is necessary to coordinate the programs of the different objectives. We all agree to ask that at mid-term of these programs, at the time of the evaluation of the guidelines, the Parliament can be one of the protagonists, because we represent the citizens. These can only accept the European Union takes decisions, at least in appearance, bureaucratic. They need the political dimension to work, that there are responsibilities, that a communication be established with the citizens. This is what we ask today to the Commissioner.I want to believe that he agrees, given his past regional president, to propose indicators and a strategy for economic and social cohesion, and not just productivity. Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of the main proposals of the report on the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of this report including the following points: there must always be an integrated approach. expenditures of the Structural Funds and the EU Cohesion Fund. This means that there must be a global partnership between local authorities and national governments to determine how to use the funds. Member States are urged to give greater importance to integrated strategies to revitalize the reports between urban and rural areas. This point is extremely important. If the renewal of our cities is very important, our policies must always strike a balance between the promotion of rural development and the improvement of the city's living environment. We do not just want to build a Europe of cities. The Structural Funds played a fundamental role in the development of urban and rural areas of peripheral countries, mainly through the improvement of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.This process will continue, in accordance with the financial guidelines that EU leaders have defined last year at the Berlin Summit and that Parliament has approved at its plenary session last May. The EU's fundamental programs between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have undoubtedly contributed to improving the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions in Europe. It is now essential to consolidate the progress so far and to make them permanent so that peripheral countries and the ultraperipher regions, the poorest regions of Europe, are able to function effectively in the new euro area, of Even within an internal market in constant expansion where there is the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. In conclusion, if the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund supported key infrastructure projects, we must remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the least favored by our society.The Social Fund has undoubtedly improved our third-level institutions, funded our postgraduate programs and put in place global plans to combat youth and long-term unemployment, help those who prematurely interrupt their schooling. and improve the level of adult literacy. Mr. Chairman, in the past, I was quite disagreement with the rapporteur for his approach to regional policy issues, but this time I subscribe to his views. I do not know if it will encourage him to continue in the same way, but I would like any cause to make my congratulations. The second thing I would like to say is that, for our part, we would prefer, as requested by Ms. McCarthy as rapporteurs of the General Regulations, that the guidelines be attached to the Regulations in the form of annex. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and Mr. Barnier is for nothing: the question was the previous Commission. I say it to recall Parliament's position. The third point I want to emphasize is that, obviously, the guidelines receive, as a whole, our consent, since they do not deviate from the comments we have made.They are of great help for the Member States, and I want to emphasize the important place granted by the Commission to the issues of sustainable development, the increase in the number of jobs - the emphasis on equality Chances - and transport. As far as I'm concerned, I totally approve these aspects. That being, I have a grievance to express as an insula as we have neglected the development of the islands. It is not granted to this question the important importance, and it is not the first time: it has been a history that lasts for the last five years that I am a member of Parliament, and I have touched on many occasions that question. Commissioner, we will continue to revive it, because in Article 158 (1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, there is a provision which provides for an integrated policy for the islands. Therefore, the Commission must finally consider this particular issue. Moreover, Commissioner, the time has finally come to put the programs in work. As a result, Member States must assume their responsibilities and do their work too. As far as we are concerned, within the Parliament, I would like to remember that there is a code of good conduct between Parliament and Commission, which has been signed in May. I am quite convinced that this code will be respected and that Parliament will be kept informed of all the developments and details of the implementation of programs.Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, my dear colleagues, during this minute and a half, I would first like to congratulate our colleague Schroedter. I believe that many have already done it, but it is that it deserves it, because it has been particularly open and attentive to the proposals of each other, and I think its availability has given its report the quality that We observe today. I will assign myself to regret that it expressed that Parliament has somehow took the process on these guidelines, since the negotiation procedure with the States is today at this advance that one can not Think that this report will have an immediate impact, what I regret. As a result, it seems to me that it must anticipate and establish the 2003 mid-term review guidelines, or even influence the second phase of programming that will follow 2003. In a few words, I would like to say that we would enter into a Period of management of the 2000-2006 programming, which should not be a routine period, for the simple reason that we have two great challenges. The first is the harmonization of national territory policies and regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to develop, when infrastructure or utilities are missing.It is therefore a substantive question that we must ask ourselves: how can we ensure that the policy of the Union is based on the national subsidiary policies of land use. The second challenge is that of enlargement, which will naturally have considerable consequences in both budgetary terms and geographical terms. These are two projects that I invite the commissioner to implement and to whom I ask him to associate ourselves with. Finally, in this period of natural disasters, I would still like to evoke the issue of the employment of the Structural Funds. It is known that it belongs to each of the states to redistribute some of the envelopes. It should not be necessary, as the states tend to want, that Europe will disappear completely. Today, public opinions, the press, accuse us of being absent subscribers while we will fund a large part of national efforts. I think we need to be able to say high and strong. I think it would also be necessary that we would instill or asked the Member States that they provide information on European aid, whenever they are mobilized to repair the damage caused by natural disasters or accidents. Mr. Chairman, the priority given to the financial and monetary criteria strengthens the rise of inequalities in all forms.For the French plan experts, for example, the most likely scenario is today a digital regional differentiations within each country. However, the Structural Funds have helped to curb this process. Our project of a Europe focused on social needs satisfying a convergence by the high of living conditions. Its implementation would certainly involve an extension of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. In particular, we propose a unified capital tax, which would fuel the funds used to support the harmonization of social protection systems and the reduction of working time at European level. However, the Commission, obliged to present orientations, only with regret and fuzzy. The proposed report today gives up its focus on politics. It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development. This will lead us to vote. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent job. I think that in the coming years before the challenge of globalization and enlargement in the East, Europe will have more than ever needed adequate and precise guidance on programming and recovery of his economy. From then on, Europe as a whole, and each of the Member States in particular, will have to best exploit all its resources and capacities, and therefore also the structural funds available.To do this, a European Commission is required which, beyond its good intentions, clarifies its guidelines and undertakes a maximum in controlling the use of these resources by the Member States. Italy, for example, in recent years, has encountered difficulties in the use of the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, a lack of information and the quasi-absent involvement of the economic and social operators at the local level. There are two points on which I would like to draw the attention of the Commission: First of all, it is necessary to best use the consultation as an instrument of coordination and participation in the decisions of local and regional operators, precisely in order to avoid imbalances and inequalities. Secondly, you really need to simplify and make the administrative processes more transparent, which too often have an unnecessary length and complexity to the point of harming the access to the funds, which are mainly complaining of small and medium-sized European enterprises. I conclude, Mr. Chairman, saying that it is pretty serious that the Commission, in its communication, has brought little attention to territorial pacts and especially to the modalities of combating unemployment among women and young people. Mr. Chairman, like my colleague, Mr.Evans, I am pleased that the first speech I come to say before this assembly is also important, especially because I represent part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has so far benefited from the funds of the Objective 2. But the report presented tonight in Parliament is an excellent example of what, if we do not care, we can create ideas that seem grandiose but lacking the substance needed to be relevant to people benefiting directly. The report itself has a good intention, but, as it often happens when we deal with these topics, lack of clarity as to its objective and a solid foundation for its operation. That's why my group and I propose three key amendments and adds to the text. In no way, it is not to remove anything from the proposal but to make it more relevant for those it intends to guide. I would like to explain our thought. First, we care about the proper use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. The experience of the past shows that we should and we owe, as elected members of European taxpayers, demand financial probity and transparency in the payment and control of the amounts allocated. Our amendments and additions are therefore aimed at establishing indicators of what we know under the expression \"to have for its money\" in the process of granting credits.Then we see too often as we spend huge amounts in projects whose outcome is inevitably uncertain at the beginning of the program period. But halfway or at the end of this period, there is no effective way to put an end to the project if it did not prove successful. Our additions therefore require practical and applicable exit strategies, so that not only can we have the necessary insurance against continuing costs that taxpayers often bear, but also that we can avoid the syndrome that consists of 'Fuck in a bad case. Finally, we ask for a change in balance and the payment method of funds. The private sector should be more involved, which will introduce the perspective of the financial reality in the financing equation. It is also necessary to avoid that the funded projects consist of projects based on income and small-scale, difficult to follow, and to focus on the important plans whose benefits are in most cases visible to all. We will reduce in this way the need, on which one ceases to insist, of transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to use unnecessarily, in the long term, the main tax base in areas Where these projects are located, and the European Parliament will show the importance it gives the need for such a reform.If the Parliament supports these amendments to the report today, they will make us, I think, move on to the next phase of the continuation of the historical objectives for which these funds have been created, namely the aid that must be financially sustainable. At the poor regions of the European Union, we need to bring to a decent standard of living, not by giving them alms but by stimulating them. I invite Parliament to support these modifications. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, I also want to congratulate the rapporteur for his report, because it was a difficult and serious job. There is no doubt that the European Union's structural policies and cohesion policy are the basic tools for creating the conditions for the development and reduction of the economic and social inequalities of the regions. The latter, despite the progress that has been realized, are still experiencing high rates and, in terms of unemployment, inadmissible rates. To better achieve the objectives of these policies, it is essential to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well-elaborate, clever guidelines, I would say. Let's not forget that these policies, when effective, become tangible for the European citizen who benefits, who directly finds the improvement of his quality of life.Neither do we need to be given special importance to remote and island areas of the European Union because they suffer from fundamental handicaps in their economic and social development because of their geographical position. Except, of course, if the Commission intends to link them to the European continent by bridges or by tunnels under the sea! Finally, I would like to point out that structural policies, as a whole, call for greater flexibility to adapt to developments and meet the new challenges and opportunities that are emerging with the advent of a new millennium, for which we all wish all the best. Mr. Chairman, no doubt that Ms. Schroedter's report contains a number of important observations and I congratulate him. But I am of the opinion that we should further worry about the guidelines and results of the regional policy of the Community. To summarize, massive unemployment, appalling, far from diminishing, further worsens in the context of structural policy. The economy and agricultural areas are irremediably affected by the regional policy practiced, with dramatic consequences for employment in campaigns and the living conditions of farmers, mainly in the South. Regional gaps are dramatically digging within the Member States.According to the sixth report data, for the last ten years, there are considerable differences in regional inequalities. Until now, it has been granted very little or no attention to the enormous problems of the union's island regions, where deficiencies in the fields of infrastructure, transport, communications and energy invariably lead to to desertification. All this is to impute both regional policy and the more general economic and social policy of the Union. Important segments of the union peoples strongly denounce the dangerous and antisocial character of this policy. The new guidelines unfortunately go in the same direction and nothing shows that their application renders a possible change. Mr. Speaker, dear colleagues, let me briefly notify two points, recalled in these reports and who are essential strategic importance in the perspective we have of the Union. The first concerns the essential and central importance that we continue to grant the principle of economic and social cohesion. We are worried about the sounds that the importance of this objective would diminish in the eyes of the Commission. We continue to think that economic and social cohesion remains a central objective of the Union.Second, I agree with what a colleague said here about the theme of the islands and I would like to draw attention to the ultraperipher regions. We would like in the future that there is more audacity in the treatment of the theme of the ultraperphery regions, which concerns in my country the islands of the Azores and Madeira. I take this opportunity to ask if the Commission can enlighten us as to the reasons for the delay in the report of the Commission on the ultraperipher regions, that Parliament has been waiting for a long time? Mr. Chairman, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, notably to have been willing to resume some of our recommendations in his report. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, through the guidelines, the Member States are offered a course of action to achieve the reform objectives as part of the programming. However, the proposals put forward by the Commission in this area represent a catalog of possible measures in the different areas rather than responding to their ambition to provide orientation. However, their original purpose is to indicate the direction to follow and set priorities.As the rapporteur, I believe that the Commission document contains unfortunately too few recommendations to the Member States in terms of administrative simplification and I want to focus on requirements such as those following: negotiations must focus on the Promoting a favorable environment for small and medium-sized labor-intensive companies, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of funding - including regulations for venture capital and private financing -, on the start-up aids - including in the field of new technologies and for investments in innovative fields. I bring my particular support to an amendment proposal made by my group in point 10, which should ensure the appropriate private sector involvement in project planning and implementation. I would repair myself, Ms. Schroedter, that you can positively consider the inclusion of this proposed amendment, and also in the interest of subsidiarity. Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee remained unanimous to say that it was strategic and priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds aimed at providing better employment opportunities. unemployed and to promote equality between men and women.Unfortunately, Schroedter's excellent report did not consider this criterion despite the many evidence and we will see later in the Report Brend from what these funds actually help the most late regions to reduce the 'gap that separates them from the most developed regions of Europe. They grow, but at the level of GDP. Their competitiveness increases, but the increase in wealth does not benefit everyone as employment does not increase and the difference in employment opportunities persists in certain regions. The Commissioner, read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and give it a priority character because that is where the main problem of citizens lies. In the revision, in the reserve assignment, take into consideration, strategically, the need for jobs as this is ultimately what the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds are required. Mr. Chairman, it is important that the guidelines make it possible to focus and enhance the effectiveness of the 2002-2006 crucial periods of the crucial period, so that sustainable development, employment aid. , especially for women and young people, and that the balance between economic, social and environmental policies be ensured.It is particularly appropriate to address acute urban problems, to preserve employment in rural areas and, of course, to offer, as specifically provided for in Article 158 of the Treaty, equal opportunities for development in the Islands of the Islands. European Union, also in the Greek Islands which represent half. The Union's cohesion policy still needs to be strengthened, because a Europe whose regions have huge living standard of living deviations can not be credible or viable. Mr. Chairman, Ladies, Members of Parliament, I would like to tell you the great interest I have taken to carefully listen to the observations, sometimes the critics and suggestions that each other you did at the moment in your interventions, from Ms. Schroedter's report. Everyone understands, the rapporteur, ladies, gentlemen, the reasons, the deadlines - I will come back there in a moment - and whatever these deadlines or delays, since it is now that we are discussing this report, I Considers, on behalf of the Commission, that it comes at the right time, acting on orientations 2000-2006, since it is at this moment that we begin the new regional programming.The rapporteur, you rightly reminded that it is mainly responsible for the Member States and the regions to define their own development priorities, the co-financing of the programs by our European Union requires, justifies that it is also also Considers the Community priorities as they are debated and approved here, to promote this Community dimension of the economic and social cohesion that many of you have remembered forcefully. Also, ladies and gentlemen, would I have wished, in a moment, to come back to the role and structure of the guidelines before evoking the main remarks or criticisms you have, Madam Rapporteur, or yourself ladies and gentlemen, made one or the other. With the role of these guidelines, President Hatzidakis, the rapporteur, Ms. McCarthy recalled that these guidelines are intended to help national and regional authorities in the preparation of their programming strategy for Each of the objectives 1, 2, 3 of the Structural Funds as well as their links with the Cohesion Fund. It is necessary to present the priorities of the Commission, supporting the past experiences during the implementation of programs, as well as current Community policies related to structural interventions.And the objective is that these priorities can contribute to better use, optimal use, effective, as many of you have desired, community interventions, including, Mr. Bradbourn, using, when the time comes The performance reserve that includes this goal to encourage optimal and efficient use of European public money. And when I talk about optimal use, I mention the national level as well as the regional level. And therefore, Mr. Sepp√§nen, I also mention here - speaking of the national level - the link with the Cohesion Fund. This is for the purpose of these orientations. S 'acting on their content, they articulate, you know, ladies and gentlemen, around three strategic priorities that your rapporteur, with a lot of clarity and at the same time a lot of ardor, as I understood Earlier in his presentation, recalled. The first priority is that of improving the competitiveness of regional economies to create, in all sectors, but singularly in the private sector, as Mr. Berend, as many serious, strong and sustainable jobs. Competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr. Evans, Wales, but not only from Wales.And I will add, since many of you have yet emphasized what appears to them as an oblivion, the regional economies of the European regions with disabilities by their remoteness, that it is in the peripheral regions, island regions. , or of course, ultraperphery regions that are furthest away. Perhaps, on this subject, may I say to Mr. Ribeiro I Castro who arrested that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these ultraperipher regions, the Commission solicited a few weeks of Additional time to publish the report that is expected. We received, on the ultraperiphering regions, the memoranda of the various governments quite late, but it is not necessarily an excuse, it is an explanation. We must take these memorandums into consideration and do an extremely serious job. I myself participated in a meeting of the ultraperipher regions on November 23 and we estimated, within the college, that we needed a few more weeks to achieve a report which is up to the highly serious problems and Serious and expectations of these ultraperipher regions, and I thank you for understanding it. This is for the first priority, that of the competitiveness of regional economies.The second, on which many of you insisted - Mr. Puerta in particular, but others still - I do not put them in an order of priority between them, it is that of the strengthening of cohesion social and employment, in particular by valuing, better than in the past, human resources. Ladies and gentlemen, a European Union where there is a greater gap between countries, which also proves effectiveness, the usefulness of the cohesion fund, but where it can be seen in the same Time, Using Unemployment - Madam Rapporteur has written it - that gaps increase between 15 or 20 richest regions and 15 or 20 poorest regions, or the most deprived, is A situation that is, which would be unjustifiable and unbearable. As far as I'm concerned - considering the idea that I am from the European construction and the regional development policy, in particular - it is a situation that I do not accept, and I have the intention, as far as I can, with your support, to put all the credits of which I have the responsibility, at the service of this better social, human, territorial cohesion, in particular for that there is not, this That I called you one day, a two-speed Europe, a Europe of the beautiful districts and a Europe of the poor suburbs.The third objective is that of urban and rural development, as part of a balanced territorial policy. In addition, the guidelines take into consideration two horizontal principles: rural development, and, Madam Rapporteur, in rural development, the question of sustainable transportation to which I have personally attached for quite long - including remembering me the moment when I was, in my country, Minister of the Environment - and the second principle e\n",

CLASQUIN GREATE CHINA 68 / ANNUAL REPORT - CLASQUIN - 2020 Note 2 Scope of consolidation The Group has been applying new standards for the scope of Consolidation IFRS 10, 11, 12 and IAS 28 amended. IFRS 10 \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" replaces IAS 27 as well as SIC 12 \"Consolidation - ad hoc entities\" for all aspects related to consolidation and consolidation procedures using the global integration method.It redefines the concept of control of an entity on the basis of three criteria: ‚Ä¢ the power over the entity, that is, the ability to direct activities that have the greatest impact on its profitability, ‚Ä¢ Exposure to the variable returns of the entity, which may be positive, in the form of dividend or any other economic advantage, or negative, ‚Ä¢ and the link between power and these returns, the ability to exercise power over The entity so as to influence the returns obtained. In practice, the companies whose group directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights in the General Assembly, the Board of Directors or within the Equivalent Executive Board, giving it the power to lead their operational and financial policies, are generally deemed controlled and consolidated according to the method of global integration. For the determination of control, the Group carries out a thorough analysis of established governance and an analysis of the rights held by other shareholders. Where necessary, an analysis of the instruments held by the group or by third parties (potential voting rights, dilutive instruments, convertible instruments ...) which, in case of exercise, could modify the type of influence exerted by each party, is also done.The overall integration consists in: ‚Ä¢ integrating into the accounts of the consolidating enterprise the elements of the consolidated financial statements, after possible restatements, ‚Ä¢ divide the equity and the result between the interests of the consolidating enterprise and the interests. Not control, ‚Ä¢ eliminate operations between the globally integrated enterprise and other consolidated companies. IFRS 11 \"Partnerships\" replaces IAS 31 for all aspects relating to the recognition of joint control entities, and the amended IAS 28 standard defines the notion of significant influence and describes the method of equity. AP applicable to participations in associates and joint ventures within the meaning of IFRS 11. Li OS Associated companies are the participations in which the Group has a significant influence, that is to say that it has no authority to participate in Financial and operational policy decisions of the entity, without exercising a joint control or SC on these policies. Te P m The Group has no interest under joint control.OC The Group recognizes its investments in associated companies using the equity method: the participation in an associated company is initially recognized at its acquisition cost in the consolidated statement of the financial situation, and then adjusted subsequently To recognize the Group's share in net income and other comprehensive income from the associated company.

They break down between short-term benefits and long-term benefits. Group employees benefit from short-term benefits such as paid leave, sick leave, premiums and other benefits (other than end-of-contract allowances) payable within twelve months after the end of the period during which employees have rendering the corresponding services. These benefits are counted in current debts and recorded in expenses when the service is returned by the employee. Within the classy group, long-term benefits cover retirement allowances.The various benefits offered to each employee depend on local legislation, conventions or agreements in force in each Group company. These advantages are characterized in two ways: LI O N The defined contribution schemes, ns o These regimes do not carry out future commitments since the obligation of the employer is limited to the regular payment of C contributions. The impact of these plans is recognized in charge of personnel when due. The defined benefit plans, M o by this nature nature, the employer guarantees a future level of benefits.

Annual report - Clastin - 2020/79 Consolidated financial statements 2020 5.2.2 Provision for Retirement As presented at the beginning of note 5.2, the long-term benefits for defined benefit plans create an obligation for the company. This obligation is recognized as a provision for pensions and assimilated commitments. This provision is evaluated in accordance with IAS 19 from the rights that would be acquired by the employees for the calculation of their end-of-career allowances, depending on: n their respective collective agreements: - for CLASQUIN SA, LCI CLASQUIN, ART Shipping and Faires & Events, the convention to be applied is that of road transport and auxiliary activities, - for LOG System and Cosmos Consultants, the Syntec Convention should be used, N of their seniority, n of financial assumptions (discount rates, Salary growth), n of demographic hypotheses (workforce turnover, retirement age, life expectancy). The discount rates are determined by reference to the returns provided by the obligations issued by first-class businesses on durations equivalent to those of the commitments on the valuation date. Actuarial gaps are generated when differences are recognized between actual data and previously conducted forecasts, or following changes in actuarial assumptions.In the case of post-employment benefits, the generated actuarial differences are recognized in the state of the overall income, net of deferred taxes in accordance with IAS 19. The calculations are carried out annually by a qualified actuary. 5.2.2.1 Key actuarial assumptions selected The main average assumptions used to determine the value of the actuarial debt of pension plans are as follows: (in thousands of euros) 2020 2019 Refresh rate 0.30% 0.80% Rate Salary progression of 2% to 3% by 2% to 3% INSEE Mortality Table 2013/2015 INSEE Men / Women 2013/2015 Turnover rate based on age groups based on age groups The sensitivity analysis, by varying the discount rate of +/- 0.25%, does not show a significant difference (+/- ‚Ç¨ 27K) on the commitment. 5.2.2.2 Evolution of the commitments The movements recorded in the liabilities are: (in thousands of euros) 2020 2019 Engagement in early earnings 1,050,809 (earnings) or actuarial losses registered in other elements of the overall result related to: 21 236 ‚Ä¢ Changes in financial and demographic hypotheses 16 292 ‚Ä¢ Experience effects 5 (56) Result recognized expenditure: 167 -2 ‚Ä¢ Service costs Rendered 161 -15 ‚Ä¢ Interest on debt 6 12 Changes of foreign exchange -5 7 Other reclassifications (1) 68 - Engagement at the end of the year 1,300 1,050 (1) certain subsidiaries had their retirement commitment in defined contributions when it comes to a defined benefit plan.

As at December 31, 2020, only the Hong Kong subsidiary noted a charge. 5.3 Payments based on share payments based on shares of free shares are granted to the Group's leaders and some employees of the group. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 \"share payment\", for plans settled in equity instruments, the overall load of the plan is calculated and fixed at the date of award of the plan.The fair value of the benefits granted to employees as part of the free action plans is estimated on the basis of the course of Li the action on the date of award, taking into account a linked discount. Dividends not perceived on the rights acquisition period. NS o It also takes into account the characteristics of the plan and a hypothesis of presence at the end of the rights period. Since the final allocation is subject to a condition of presence, this personnel burden is recognized a linearly on the period MO of acquisition of rights in return for equity. The group periodically reviews the number of free shares to c hand up with a partial or total non-injury expected from performance criteria. Where appropriate, the consequences of the revision of the estimates are reflected in the income statement. The impact on the income statement is included in the \"Personnel Expenses\".

The positive differences between the acquisition cost and the share of the acquirer in the fair value of the assets, liabilities, and possible identifiable liabilities are recognized as goodwill to the assets of the balance sheet. If goodwill is negative, it is immediately noted in profit from the income statement. Since the entry into force of IFRS 3 revised on January 1, 2010, the Group applies the following principles: n Transaction fees are recognized immediately in other operating expenses when incurred, n for each grouping, the group analyzes The opportunity to opt for the accounting of a goodwill called \"complete\", that is, taking into account the share of Goodwill returning to interest attributable to the interests which does not give control on the date of acquisition (evaluated at fair value), or for the accounting of a goodwill called \"partial\", which amounts to assessing the interest attributable to the interests that do not give control for their share in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired N, any potential price adjustment is estimated at fair value at the date of acquisition.This initial assessment can not be adjusted later in return for goodwill only in the event of new information related to circumstances existing on the date of acquisition and to the extent that this assessment occurs during the interlayer (12 months). Any adjustment after the intercount period of the financial debt recorded in respect of a price supplement, which does not meet these criteria, is recognized in return for the overall result of the Group. In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is subject to value testing as soon as the impairment index appears, and at least once a year, depending on the method of updating future cash flows ( Discounted Cash Flows - DCF). For these tests, assets are grouped into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows resulting from continuous operations and which are completely independent of cash inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets. With regard to the organization in place in the group, two UGTs were determined which correspond to the two operational sectors as defined in note 3: s d n the operational sector of air transport, maritime and associated benefits (historical activity of the group), Li OS n the computer provider sector.The modalities of the test tests of cash generating units are detailed in paragraph 7.5 of this chapter. PMO if the goodwill has been assigned to a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) and if an activity within this unit is sold, the goodwill linked to the activity exit is included in the book value activity when determining the result of assignment. The goodwill thus assigned is evaluated on the basis of the relative values ‚Äã‚Äãof the ceded activity and from the conserved cash generating unit. When subsidiaries are ceded, the difference between the transfer price and the transferred net asset increased from the accumulated conversion differences and the net worth of goodwill is recognized in the income statement.

The intangible assets resulting from an acquisition are recognized separately from goodwill when identifiable, controlled by the group and that they are likely to generate future economic benefits. Research and Development Fees Internally generated research costs are recorded in charges when they are incurred.Development expenditure is recognized in intangible assets, when completing the criteria defined by IAS 38 and in particular if and only if it is possible to demonstrate: n the technical feasibility necessary for the completion of the software for the purpose of its commissioning or sale, n its intention to complete the software or use it or sell it, n its ability to use or sell the software, n how the software under development will generate Probable future economic benefits; In particular, it must be demonstrated by the existence of a market for the software under development, n the availability of technical, financial and other resources, appropriate to complete the development and use or sell the software, n its ability to evaluate in such a way. reliable expenses attributable to the software during its development.

Sexenna Annual Report - CLASQUIN - 2020/87 Consolidated financial statements 2020 7.4 Rental rights relating to leases (IFRS16) The updated value of future rental contracts is taken into account at the level at the balance sheet from the origin of the contract . This value is recognized as \"rental debts\" in the liabilities with asset registration in \"Rights of Rental Contracts\". The contracts are amortized over the duration of the contract which generally corresponds to the firm duration of the contract unless an intention to renew or terminate the contract in advance is known.The impacts on the income statement are presented within the operating routine result and within the financial result, respectively in depreciation charges and interest charges. The tax impact of this reprocessing is integrated when accounting for deferred taxes. Lease agreements corresponding to low unit value assets (<5K ‚Ç¨) or short-term (<12 months) are recorded directly in charges. Property, plant and equipment are estimated at historical cost and are not subject to any revaluation. IFRS16 \"rental agreements\" has become mandatory as of January 1, 2019. It requires to retreat all lease agreements with a residual period of January 1, 2019, is greater than 12 months and including the value of the asset. Jacent is greater than 5 K ‚Ç¨. The Group subscribes for office rental agreements in most cities where it operates, vehicles of function of its staff in representation, as well as software in 'SaaS' (Software As A Service) and computer servers. Previously at the entry into force of IFRS16, and pursuant to IAS 17, these contracts were qualified as 'simple rentals' and were not restated in the financial statements.The group does not subscribe to a financing lease, IAS 17 was not finding to apply to past exercises. In application of IFRS16, the real estate rental and rental contracts are now recognized as the assets by the recognition of a duty of use and the liabilities by a debt corresponding to the updated value of future payments. The rental period is defined contract per contract and corresponds to the firm period of the commitment taking into account the optional periods that are reasonably certain of being exercised, depending on the legislation specific to each country. Contracts for the use of computer licenses and servers were considered as service contracts to the extent that the suppliers have the substantial right to replace or modify the underlying assets throughout their duration of use. The transition method retained consists of counting the cumulative effect of the initial application as an adjustment on open equity by considering that the asset under the right of use is equal to the amount of the rental obligations, adjusted Amount of rents paid in advance (no benefit received from donors or rehabilitation costs).The discount rates applied on the transition date are based on the group's marginal borrowing rate to which a SPRead is added to account for the country's specific economic environments. These discount rates were determined taking into account the residual periods of contracts from the date of first application, or January 1, 2019.

The detailed analysis of real estate lease and activated development contracts led the group to revise certain durations selected beyond their non-cancellable duration, with an impact primarily on the rental agreement for its head office in Lyon. The AMF recommends that this IFRIC decision be taken into account with retroactive effect on 1 January 2019; The IAS 8 standard is therefore applied to the 2019 financial statements, which are corrected as a comparative basis of the fiscal year 2020: Dec. 31. 2019 modify.

The recoverable amount of fixed assets is estimated and impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its recoverable amount. The losses of value noted may be reversed later if the recoverable amount becomes higher than the net book value, within the limit of the initially recognized depreciation decreased depreciation which would have been recognized if no loss of value had been noted. The recoverable amount of an asset is the highest value between the net sale price of the exit costs of the asset and its determined utility value by estimating the future financial flows generated by the asset. Intangible assets with indeterminate utility and goodwill assets with indeterminate utility are not amortized but are subject to a depreciation test at each annual closure, and whenever there is any index of impairment. .For this test, fixed assets are grouped into cash-generating unit (UGT) which is defined as a homogeneous set of assets caused distinct cash inflows of those of other asset groups. The Group has defined two distinct CGUs: n Operating entity generating independent cash flows, n whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the main operational decision-maker of the entity in order to make decisions about resources to be assigned to the sector and. Evaluate its performance, n for which separate financial information is available. Given this definition, the CGUs defined within the Group are as follows: N ugt 1: Engineering in air, maritime transport and associated services (\"Overseas freight\"), N ugt 2: computer provider (\"IT benefits\"). The utility value of the assets is defined by updating the Net Future Flows (DCF - Discounted Cash Flows). The determination of the utility value therefore assumes, on the one hand, to determine the cash flow from the continuous use of the asset and its output and, on the other hand, to apply to these flows the appropriate discount rate.The modalities used for the determination of the discount rate will have to ensure consistency with the risks of integrated risk in the determination of the cash flows themselves. Thus the standard defines the discount rate as a rate reflecting current assessments by the value market value of money and asset-specific risks that future cash flows have not been adjusted. This is the investor's return on investment rate would ask if they had to choose an investment that generates cash flows, including the amount, maturity and risk profile would be equivalent to those that the company expects to obtain from the asset itself. The rate is therefore in principle, a market data and not a data specific to the company or its ability to generate cash flow through the use of the assets tested. The discount rate (WACC) can thus be specific and incorporate risk specificities specific to each cash-generating unit. These impairment tests are also subject to sensitivity testing on the infinity rate and WACC, to ensure that the modification of these assumptions does not change the conclusion of the depreciation test.Value losses are recorded when the net book value of an asset or its UGT is greater than its reopen thus determined, in a specific section of the income statement. A loss of value recognized in respect of a CGU is allocated first to the reduction of the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets of the UGT (prorated The carrying amount of each IGT asset). The loss of value assigned to goodwill is irreversible and will not be subject to a recovery in case the recoverable amount of goodwill becomes superior again than its carrying amount. The carrying amount of an asset, increased due to the recovery of a loss of value, must not be greater than the carrying amount which would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no loss of value had been recognized.92 / ANNUAL REPORT - CLASQUIN - 2020 Impairment test at December 31, 2020, the assumptions used to determine the discount rate of each CGU are as follows: n A non-risk rate of 0.00%, corresponding to the average monthly 2020 of the TEC rate 10 years (-0.16%), but can not be less than 0% by prudence, n a market risk premium of 8.20% (long-term retrospective trend), defined by reference to The risk premium required by investors in the small and medium-capable market, n a specific risk premium, called \"beta\" volatility coefficient, which takes into account the activity of each subsidiary, maturity, existence or not a portfolio of recurring activities and the distribution of customers in this portfolio, estimated at 1.22, a financial expense rate of 1.0% for Overseas and 0.6% Freight UGT for CGU Computer benefits. The WACC applies to 8.2% for the Overseas and 10.4% CGUs for the UGT IT Benefits, and an infinite growth rate defined at 2%. Sensitivity tests A combined variation of more or less 1% of the assumptions used for calculations (discount rate and growth rate) does not show upholding. The growth rate beyond the reference period is 2%.S ED LI OSNOCSETPMOC CLASQUIN USA SLEUNNAETPMOCSEXENNA ANNUAL REPORT - CLASQUIN - 2020/93 Consolidated financial statements 2020 Note 8 Financial financial and financial instruments Financial liabilities The evaluation and classification of financial assets depends not only with contractual features related to financial instruments. also the asset management model defined by the Group. During their initial recognition, according to IFRS 9, the financial assets are analyzed and classified according to the three categories: those assessed at amortized cost, those assessed at fair value by equity and those estimated at fair value per result. The financial assets held by the group includes unbound equity securities, loans and receivables at amortized cost, including client receivables, as well as active derivative financial instruments. Financial liabilities include borrowing and financial debts, financial derivative financial instruments, supplier debt and banking competitions. The ranking of financial assets and liabilities, between currents and non-current, is determined by maturity at the closing date that is less than one year, exceeding one year. Evaluation and ranking of financial assets and liabilities FINANCIAL ACTIVE ACTIVITIES Rated at amortized cost The financial assets evaluated at amortized cost relate primarily to loans and receivables.The management model, allowing them to classify them in this category, is to hold the assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and give rise to cash flows corresponding only to the payment of the principal and its Interest (\"SPPI\" criterion). Financial assets assessed at fair value by equity This asset class refers to debt instruments and equity instruments. Debt instruments are valued at fair value by OIC if the contractual cash flows consist solely of the principal and interest payments reflecting the value time value as well as at the credit risk associated with the instrument. (\"SPPI\" criterion according to IFRS 9). During the life of the instrument, interest products, losses and foreign exchange gains as well as the impairments attached to the assets are recorded in the income statement. Other changes in fair value are recognized in OIC. At the time of the assignment of these assets, the cumulative variations of fair value are transferred to the income statement. The group does not have any instruments of this nature. Some equity securities relating to non-consolidated companies that are not held for transaction purposes, can be measured at fair value by OIC.Investment investment, the group makes the irrevocable choice to classify them in this category. Cumulative changes in fair value will be recognized in OIC and will not be recycled to the income statement in the event of an assignment. Only the perceived dividends are recognized in the income statement within \"other financial products\" unless they represent a recovery of part of the cost of investment. The group does not hold a significant asset in this category. In their initial recognition, these financial assets are recorded at fair value, increased if necessary transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES Raised at fair value This category resumes all assets that are not classified as being assessed at amortized cost or assessed at fair value by equity. This is: n of non-consolidated equity securities for which the Group has not retained the irrevocable option to rank them at fair value by equity, n of debt titles that do not meet the SPPI management model, N Assets acquired from the beginning with the intention of resale at short maturity, n of unqualified derivatives of hedging instruments. At the transaction date, these assets are recognized at fair value.In most cases, this amount will be equal to the disbursed amount. Transaction costs attributable to their acquisition are recognized in the income statement. At each decree, changes in fair value are recognized as \"other financial products and expenses\". 94 / Annual Report - CLASQUIN - 2020 Loans and other financial liabilities Loans and other financial liabilities are valued at the fair value of the receipt and then accounted for using the amortized cost method. The receipt receives the net amount received: value of acquisition or issue of liabilities decreased by transaction costs, emission premiums and directly attributable reimbursement premiums. These fees are then amortized over the life of the liabilities according to the TIE method. The interest expenses thus calculated are recognized in the \"Cost of Net Financial Debt\" income statement. Supplier debts are maintained in the \"Suppliers\" category as long as they are not substantially modified in their deadlines, counterparts and facial values. Some financial liabilities are valued at fair value. For the group, they primarily correspond to derivative instruments, whose changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.Indeed, the group does not have liabilities held for transaction purposes, which meet a short-term achievement intent. Impairment of IFRS 9 Financial Assets introduced a model of impairment based on expected credit losses called ECL (\"Expsected Credit Loss\"). This impairment model concerns financial assets assets at amortized cost, assets on contracts and debt instruments valued at fair value by OIC. The main financial assets of the group that are concerned are loan and receivables. The Group retained an approach allowing it to estimate, as soon as the initial recognition of the claim, the expected credit risk. This method uses a matrix associating the probability of default of the counterpart and the evolution of the credit risk related to each counterparty in the light of the credit insurance policy set up by the group.Devocation of Financial Assets and Liabilities The Group dedicates a Financial Asset When: N Contractual Cash Flow Rights Expires, or N Rights to receive the contractual cash flows associated with that assets were transferred to a third party. and that this transfer meets certain conditions: s) if almost all the risks and benefits related to the ownership of this asset have been transferred, the asset is derecognized for its total Li O, NS OC II) if The Group retains almost all risks and benefits, assets remains recognized for its entirety. The Group dedicates a financial liability when its contractual obligations are extinguished, canceled or expires. P m When a debt restructuring takes place with a lender, and that the terms are substantially different, the group records O C a new liability. Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce its exhibitions on currency and interest rate risks. All derivative instruments are on the balance sheet at their fair value as soon as the subscription date and at each closure as the instrument is alive.The variations of fair value, gains or losses depend on the qualification of the derivative as a hedging instrument or not but also of the nature of the covered element. S E T P For derivative instruments that are not hedging instrument qualities, changes in just are recognized as a financial result during the period on which they relate. C covered derivatives There are three types of coverage: ‚Ä¢ Covers of fair value This is a coverage for the fair value of an asset or liability recognized in the balance sheet or a firm commitment of Buy or sell an asset. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in profit or loss, in parallel with changes in fair value of the covered items, for the section relating to the covered risk. If the cover E X is totally effective, the two effects neutralize perfectly; NE NO ANNUAL REPORT - CLASQUIN - 2020/95 Consolidated financial statements 2020 ‚Ä¢ Cash flow covers are affected by this category Highly probable future transactions or exposure to the variability of cash flows associated with an asset or liability. Cash flow variations generated by the covered element are offset by the variations in value of the hedging instrument.The effective part of changes in fair value of derivative instruments is recognized in other reserves. The gain or loss that relates to the ineffective part is immediately recognized as a result. When the sale or maturity of a hedging instrument, or when a hedge instrument no longer fulfills the criteria required to benefit from the accounting of hedge, the amount accumulated in other reserves at that date is immediately counted in profit or loss. ‚Ä¢ Covers of a net investment abroad Fair value variations are recognized in other elements of the overall income tax, for its effective part and in financial income for its inefficient share. At the date of disposal of net investment or in its liquidation, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled in profit or loss. The coverage accounting is applicable according to IFRS 9 if: n The hedging relationship includes only the hedging instruments and eligible covered items, n the coverage relationship is clearly established and is the subject of formal documentation. From its implementation, n the effectiveness of the coverage set up is demonstrated from its origin and that it meets the constraints of coverage efficiency and in particular the coverage ratio.Unqualified derivatives of coverage The changes in fair value of a derivative financial instrument, which has not been (or is no longer) qualified as hedges, are recorded directly as a result of the period, within the \"Other\" Financial products and expenses \".

Some of these measures, such as travel restrictions and remote work, also had an impact on the internal organization of companies and the modalities for implementing audits. It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your knowledge the following assessments which, which, According to our professional judgment, were the most important for the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year.

This virus has circulated actively in several countries including France and restrictive measures have been taken. While ensuring the continuity of the activity when it was possible, the Clasquin group favored the health of its employees and ensured to respect these restrictive measures. In this context, the crisis related to the spread of COVID-19 had a strong impact on certain classroom activities, particularly during the first period of confinement and curfew. The impact of the health crisis and its consequences on the activity and performance of the CLASQUIN company resulted in the control of fixed and variable costs that reduced the costs of the year and the use of the Partial unemployment. The variations in performance observed in the financial statements of the Company mainly reflect the effects of the health crisis. Given multiple impacts, but also savings measures that have been implemented, it is not possible to isolate in the variation of the performance the share that would be attributable to CVIV-19.In respect of the support measures granted by the State, the Company benefited from partial unemployment benefits ‚Ç¨ 2.2 million. The health crisis related to COVID-19 does not call into question the group's business model and its fundamentals but pushes it to adapt its processes. Risk mapping is regularly updated and will be adapted for feedback from crisis management, including the establishment of rapid and adapted protective measures for its employees during the occurrence of epidemiological crises. The appreciation of foreign exchange, liquidity and credit risks has not changed from December 31, 2019. The Group has ‚Ç¨ 57.5 million of lines of credit, including ‚Ç¨ 30 million in the form of RCF confirmed. As at December 31, 2020, Calaquin SA used for ‚Ç¨ 21 million and is not broken in covenants. The company will be able to cope with its echo of the next twelve months. 3 Information on the balance sheet 3.1 Asset Information 3.1.1 Intangible Assets Assets are valued at their acquisition value.

This appreciation relies on the elements collected until the date of its report, however, be recalled that subsequent circumstances or events could call into question the continuity of exploitation.If it concludes with the existence of significant uncertainty, it draws the attention of readers of its report to the information provided in the annual accounts regarding this uncertainty or, if this information is not provided or are not relevant, it makes a reservation certification or a refusal to certify; n He appreciates the overall presentation of the annual accounts and evaluates whether the annual accounts reflect the underlying operations and events so as to give a faithful image.

EU N 2. Risk Financial Analysis A E T P 2.1 Financial Risk Management M O C 2.1.1 Liquidity Risk Management Group's investments focus on projects related to projects, arrangements and affairs of subsidiaries. Investments are funded by medium and long-term borrowings or equity. The working capital requirement is funded by the Group's cash flow, by revolving Credit Facility set up on November 27, 2019 (see below) and punctually bank overdrafts. It is experiencing significant variations during the year, due to the monthly settlement dates for the customs administration (customs duties and VAT) and at the Cargo Accounting Settlement System (CASS), which is a body of airlines. In order to simplify the billing of their services to transport commissionaires. Exe some borrowings in the classy group have a banking \"covenant\": it is the leverage ratio that must be less than 3. NNA Annual Report - CLASQUIN - 2020/151 Annexes 2.1.2 Rate Risks The Borrowings Contracted by the Group CLASQUIN may be at a fixed rate or variable rate (refer to the table in paragraph 8.1.3.1 \"Composition\" of point B \"Notes annexed to the consolidated financial statements\"). Depending on the evolution of the rates on the market, the Group may put in place rate coverage at any time, on its initiative (refer to the table of paragraph 8.4.2.2 \"Exposure to interest rate risk\" from point B \"Notes Annex to Consolidated Financial Statements\"). 2.1.3 Inflation risks The Company considers that it is not exposed to inflationary risk to the extent that the increase in freight rates, due to inflation, has passed on to its sales rates.
